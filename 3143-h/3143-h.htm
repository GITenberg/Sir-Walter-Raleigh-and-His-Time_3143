<h1>SIR WALTER RALEIGH AND HIS TIME <a name="citation87"></a><a
href="#footnote87" class="citation">[87]</a></h1>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Truth</span> is stranger than
fiction.&rsquo;&nbsp; A trite remark.&nbsp; We all say it again
and again: but how few of us believe it!&nbsp; How few of us,
when we read the history of heroical times and heroical men, take
the story simply as it stands!&nbsp; On the contrary, we try to
explain it away; to prove it all not to have been so very
wonderful; to impute accident, circumstance, mean and commonplace
motives; to lower every story down to the level of our own
littleness, or what we (unjustly to ourselves and to the God who
is near us all) choose to consider our level; to rationalise away
all the wonders, till we make them at last impossible, and give
up caring to believe them; and prove to our own melancholy
satisfaction that Alexander conquered the world with a pin, in
his sleep, by accident.</p>
<p>And yet in this mood, as in most, there is a sort of
left-handed truth involved.&nbsp; These heroes are not so far
removed from us after all.&nbsp; They were men of like passions
with ourselves, with the same flesh about them, the same spirit
within them, the same world outside, the same devil beneath, the
same God above.&nbsp; They and their deeds were not so very
wonderful.&nbsp; Every child who is born into the world is just
as wonderful, and, for aught we know, might, <i>mutatis
mutandis</i>, do just as wonderful deeds.&nbsp; If accident and
circumstance helped them, the same may help us: have helped us,
if we will look back down our years, far more than we have made
use of.</p>
<p>They were men, certainly, very much of our own level: but may
we not put that level somewhat too low?&nbsp; They were certainly
not what we are; for if they had been, they would have done no
more than we: but is not a man&rsquo;s real level not what he is,
but what he can be, and therefore ought to be?&nbsp; No doubt
they were compact of good and evil, just as we: but so was David,
no man more; though a more heroical personage (save One) appears
not in all human records but may not the secret of their success
have been that, on the whole (though they found it a sore
battle), they refused the evil and chose the good?&nbsp; It is
true, again, that their great deeds may be more or less
explained, attributed to laws, rationalised: but is explaining
always explaining away?&nbsp; Is it to degrade a thing to
attribute it to a law?&nbsp; And do you do anything more by
&lsquo;rationalising&rsquo; men&rsquo;s deeds than prove that
they were rational men; men who saw certain fixed laws, and
obeyed them, and succeeded thereby, according to the Baconian
apophthegm, that nature is conquered by obeying her?</p>
<p>But what laws?</p>
<p>To that question, perhaps, the eleventh chapter of the Epistle
to the Hebrews will give the best answer, where it says, that by
faith were done all the truly great deeds, and by faith lived all
the truly great men who have ever appeared on earth.</p>
<p>There are, of course, higher and lower degrees of this faith;
its object is one more or less worthy: but it is in all cases the
belief in certain unseen eternal facts, by keeping true to which
a man must in the long run succeed.&nbsp; Must; because he is
more or less in harmony with heaven, and earth, and the Maker
thereof, and has therefore fighting on his side a great portion
of the universe; perhaps the whole; for as he who breaks one
commandment of the law is guilty of the whole, because he denies
the fount of all law, so he who with his whole soul keeps one
commandment of it is likely to be in harmony with the whole,
because he testifies of the fount of all law.</p>
<p>I shall devote a few pages to the story of an old hero, of a
man of like passions with ourselves; of one who had the most
intense and awful sense of the unseen laws, and succeeded
mightily thereby; of one who had hard struggles with a flesh and
blood which made him at times forget those laws, and failed
mightily thereby; of one whom God so loved that He caused each
slightest sin, as with David, to bring its own punishment with
it, that while the flesh was delivered over to Satan, the man
himself might be saved in the Day of the Lord; of one, finally,
of whom nine hundred and ninety-nine men out of a thousand may
say, &lsquo;I have done worse deeds than he: but I have never
done as good ones.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a poor farm-house among the pleasant valleys of South
Devon, among the white apple-orchards and the rich water-meadows,
and the red fallows and red kine, in the year of grace 1552, a
boy was born, as beautiful as day, and christened Walter
Raleigh.&nbsp; His father was a gentleman of ancient blood: few
older in the land: but, impoverished, he had settled down upon
the wreck of his estate, in that poor farm-house.&nbsp; No record
of him now remains; but he must have been a man worth knowing and
worth loving, or he would not have won the wife he did.&nbsp; She
was a Champernoun, proudest of Norman squires, and could probably
boast of having in her veins the blood of Courtneys, Emperors of
Byzant.&nbsp; She had been the wife of the famous knight Sir Otho
Gilbert, and lady of Compton Castle, and had borne him three
brave sons, John, Humphrey, and Adrian; all three destined to win
knighthood also in due time, and the two latter already giving
promises, which they well fulfilled, of becoming most remarkable
men of their time.&nbsp; And yet the fair Champernoun, at her
husband&rsquo;s death, had chosen to wed Mr. Raleigh, and share
life with him in the little farm-house at Hayes.&nbsp; She must
have been a grand woman, if the law holds true that great men
always have great mothers; an especially grand woman, indeed; for
few can boast of having borne to two different husbands such sons
as she bore.&nbsp; No record, as far as we know, remains of her;
nor of her boy&rsquo;s early years.&nbsp; One can imagine them,
nevertheless.</p>
<p>Just as he awakes to consciousness, the Smithfield fires are
extinguished.&nbsp; He can recollect, perhaps, hearing of the
burning of the Exeter martyrs: and he does not forget it; no one
forgot or dared forget it in those days.&nbsp; He is brought up
in the simple and manly, yet high-bred ways of English gentlemen
in the times of &lsquo;an old courtier of the
Queen&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&nbsp; His two elder half-brothers also,
living some thirty miles away, in the quaint and gloomy towers of
Compton Castle, amid the apple-orchards of Torbay, are men as
noble as ever formed a young lad&rsquo;s taste.&nbsp; Humphrey
and Adrian Gilbert, who afterwards, both of them, rise to
knighthood, are&mdash;what are they not?&mdash;soldiers,
scholars, Christians, discoverers and &lsquo;planters&rsquo; of
foreign lands, geographers, alchemists, miners, Platonical
philosophers; many-sided, high-minded men, not without fantastic
enthusiasm; living heroic lives, and destined, one of them, to
die a heroic death.&nbsp; From them Raleigh&rsquo;s fancy has
been fired, and his appetite for learning quickened, while he is
yet a daring boy, fishing in the gray trout-brooks, or going up
with his father to the Dartmoor hills to hunt the deer with hound
and horn, amid the wooded gorges of Holne, or over the dreary
downs of Hartland Warren, and the cloud-capt thickets of
Cator&rsquo;s Beam, and looking down from thence upon the far
blue southern sea, wondering when he shall sail thereon, to fight
the Spaniard, and discover, like Columbus, some fairy-land of
gold and gems.</p>
<p>For before this boy&rsquo;s mind, as before all intense
English minds of that day, rise, from the first, three fixed
ideas, which yet are but one&mdash;the Pope, the Spaniard, and
America.</p>
<p>The two first are the sworn and internecine enemies (whether
they pretend a formal peace or not) of Law and Freedom, Bible and
Queen, and all that makes an Englishman&rsquo;s life dear to
him.&nbsp; Are they not the incarnations of Antichrist?&nbsp;
Their Moloch sacrifices flame through all lands.&nbsp; The earth
groans because of them, and refuses to cover the blood of her
slain.&nbsp; And America is the new world of boundless wonder and
beauty, wealth and fertility, to which these two evil powers
arrogate an exclusive and divine right; and God has delivered it
into their hands; and they have done evil therein with all their
might, till the story of their greed and cruelty rings through
all earth and heaven.&nbsp; Is this the will of God?&nbsp; Will
he not avenge for these things, as surely as he is the Lord who
executeth justice and judgment in the earth?</p>
<p>These are the young boy&rsquo;s thoughts.&nbsp; These were his
thoughts for sixty-six eventful years.&nbsp; In whatsoever else
he wavered, he never wavered in that creed.&nbsp; He learnt it in
his boyhood, while he read &lsquo;Fox&rsquo;s Martyrs&rsquo;
beside his mother&rsquo;s knee.&nbsp; He learnt it as a lad, when
he saw his neighbours Hawkins and Drake changed by Spanish
tyranny and treachery from peaceful merchantmen into fierce
scourges of God.&nbsp; He learnt it scholastically, from fathers
and divines, as an Oxford scholar, in days when Oxford was a
Protestant indeed, in whom there was no guile.&nbsp; He learnt it
when he went over, at seventeen years old, with his gallant
kinsman Henry Champernoun, and his band of a hundred gentlemen
volunteers, to flesh his maiden sword in behalf of the persecuted
French Protestants.&nbsp; He learnt it as he listened to the
shrieks of the San Bartholomew; he learnt it as he watched the
dragonnades, the tortures, the massacres of the Netherlands, and
fought manfully under Norris in behalf of those victims of
&lsquo;the Pope and Spain.&rsquo;&nbsp; He preached it in far
stronger and wiser words than I can express it for him, in that
noble tract of 1591, on Sir Richard Grenville&rsquo;s death at
the Azores&mdash;a Tyrt&aelig;an trumpet-blast such as has seldom
rung in human ears; he discussed it like a cool statesman in his
pamphlet of 1596, on &lsquo;A War with Spain.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
sacrificed for it the last hopes of his old age, the wreck of his
fortunes, his just recovered liberty; and he died with the old
God&rsquo;s battle-cry upon his lips, when it awoke no response
from the hearts of a coward, profligate, and unbelieving
generation.&nbsp; This is the background, the keynote of the
man&rsquo;s whole life.&nbsp; If we lose the recollection of it,
and content ourselves by slurring it over in the last pages of
his biography with some half-sneer about his putting, like the
rest of Elizabeth&rsquo;s old admirals, &lsquo;the Spaniard, the
Pope, and the Devil&rsquo; in the same category, then we shall
understand very little about Raleigh; though, of course, we shall
save ourselves the trouble of pronouncing as to whether the
Spaniard and the Pope were really in the same category as the
devil; or, indeed, which might be equally puzzling to a good many
historians of the last century and a half, whether there be any
devil at all.</p>
<p>The books which I have chosen to head this review are all of
them more or less good, with one exception, and that is Bishop
Goodman&rsquo;s Memoirs, on which much stress has been lately
laid, as throwing light on various passages of Raleigh, Essex,
Cecil, and James&rsquo;s lives.&nbsp; Having read it carefully, I
must say plainly, that I think the book an altogether foolish,
pedantic, and untrustworthy book, without any power of insight or
gleam of reason; without even the care to be self-consistent;
having but one object, the whitewashing of James, and of every
noble lord whom the bishop has ever known: but in whitewashing
each, the poor old flunkey so bespatters all the rest of his
pets, that when the work is done, the whole party look, if
possible, rather dirtier than before.&nbsp; And so I leave Bishop
Goodman.</p>
<p>Mr. Fraser Tytler&rsquo;s book is well known; and it is on the
whole a good one; because he really loves and admires the man of
whom he writes: but he is sometimes careless as to authorities,
and too often makes the wish father to the thought.&nbsp;
Moreover, he has the usual sentiment about Mary Queen of Scots,
and the usual scandal about Elizabeth, which is simply anathema;
and which prevents his really seeing the time in which Raleigh
lived, and the element in which he moved.&nbsp; This sort of talk
is happily dying out just now; but no one can approach the
history of the Elizabethan age (perhaps of any age) without
finding that truth is all but buried under mountains of dirt and
chaff&mdash;an Aug&aelig;an stable, which, perhaps, will never be
swept clean.&nbsp; Yet I have seen, with great delight, several
attempts toward removal of the said superstratum of dirt and
chaff from the Elizabethan histories, in several articles, all
evidently from the same pen (and that one, more perfectly master
of English prose than any man living), in the &lsquo;Westminster
Review&rsquo; and &lsquo;Fraser&rsquo;s Magazine.&rsquo; <a
name="citation95"></a><a href="#footnote95"
class="citation">[95]</a></p>
<p>Sir Robert Schomburgk&rsquo;s edition of the Guiana Voyage
contains an excellent Life of Raleigh, perhaps the best yet
written; of which I only complain, when it gives in to the
stock-charges against Raleigh, as it were at second-hand, and
just because they are stock-charges, and when, too, the
illustrious editor (unable to conceal his admiration of a
discoverer in many points so like himself) takes all through an
apologetic tone of &lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t laugh at me.&nbsp; I
daresay it is very foolish; but I can&rsquo;t help loving the
man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Napier&rsquo;s little book is a reprint of two
&lsquo;Edinburgh Review&rsquo; articles on Bacon and
Raleigh.&nbsp; The first, a learned statement of facts in answer
to some unwisdom of a &lsquo;Quarterly&rsquo; reviewer (possibly
an Oxford Aristotelian; for &lsquo;we think we do know that sweet
Roman hand&rsquo;).&nbsp; It is clear, accurate, convincing,
complete.&nbsp; There is no more to be said about the matter,
save that facts are stubborn things.</p>
<p>The article on Raleigh is very valuable; first, because Mr.
Napier has had access to many documents unknown to former
biographers; and next, because he clears Raleigh completely from
the old imputation of deceit about the Guiana mine, as well as of
other minor charges.&nbsp; With his general opinion of
Raleigh&rsquo;s last and fatal Guiana voyage, I have the
misfortune to differ from him <i>toto coelo</i>, on the strength
of the very documents which he quotes.&nbsp; But Mr. Napier is
always careful, always temperate, and always just, except where
he, as I think, does not enter into the feelings of the man whom
he is analysing.&nbsp; Let readers buy the book (it will tell
them a hundred things they do not know) and be judge between Mr.
Napier and me.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, one cannot help watching with a smile how
good old Time&rsquo;s scrubbing-brush, which clears away paint
and whitewash from church pillars, does the same by such
characters as Raleigh&rsquo;s.&nbsp; After each fresh
examination, some fresh count in the hundred-headed indictment
breaks down.&nbsp; The truth is, that as people begin to believe
more in nobleness, and to gird up their loins to the doing of
noble deeds, they discover more nobleness in others.&nbsp;
Raleigh&rsquo;s character was in its lowest nadir in the days of
Voltaire and Hume.&nbsp; What shame to him?&nbsp; For so were
more sacred characters than his.&nbsp; Shall the disciple be
above his master? especially when that disciple was but too
inconsistent, and gave occasion to the uncircumcised to
blaspheme?&nbsp; But Cayley, after a few years, refutes
triumphantly Hume&rsquo;s silly slanders.&nbsp; He is a stupid
writer: but he has sense enough, being patient, honest, and
loving, to do that.</p>
<p>Mr. Fraser Tytler shovels away a little more of the dirt-heap;
Mr. Napier clears him (for which we owe him many thanks), by
simple statement of facts, from the charge of having deserted and
neglected his Virginia colonists; Humboldt and Schomburgk clear
him from the charge of having lied about Guiana; and so on; each
successive writer giving in generally on merest hearsay to the
general complaint against him, either from fear of running
counter to big names, or from mere laziness, and yet absolving
him from that particular charge of which his own knowledge
enables him to judge.&nbsp; In the trust that I may be able to
clear him from a few more charges, I write these pages, premising
that I do not profess to have access to any new and recondite
documents.&nbsp; I merely take the broad facts of the story from
documents open to all; and comment on them as every man should
wish his own life to be commented on.</p>
<p>But I do so on a method which I cannot give up; and that is
the Bible method.&nbsp; I say boldly that historians have
hitherto failed in understanding not only Raleigh and Elizabeth,
but nine-tenths of the persons and facts in his day, because they
will not judge them by the canons which the Bible lays
down&mdash;by which I mean not only the New Testament but the
Old, which, as English Churchmen say, and Scotch Presbyterians
have ere now testified with sacred blood, is &lsquo;not contrary
to the New.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Napier has a passage about Raleigh for which I am sorry,
coming as it does from a countryman of John Knox.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Society, it would seem, was yet in a state in which such a
man could seriously plead, that the madness he feigned was
justified&rsquo; (his last word is unfair, for Raleigh only hopes
that it is no sin) &lsquo;by the example of David, King of
Israel.&rsquo;&nbsp; What a shocking state of society when men
actually believed their Bibles, not too little, but too
much.&nbsp; For my part, I think that if poor dear Raleigh had
considered the example of David a little more closely, he need
never have feigned madness at all; and that his error lay quite
in an opposite direction from looking on the Bible heroes, David
especially, as too sure models.&nbsp; At all events, let us try
Raleigh by the very scriptural standard which he himself lays
down, not merely in this case unwisely, but in his &lsquo;History
of the World&rsquo; more wisely than any historian whom I have
ever read; and say, &lsquo;Judged as the Bible taught our Puritan
forefathers to judge every man, the character is intelligible
enough; tragic, but noble and triumphant: judged as men have been
judged in history for the last hundred years, by hardly any canon
save those of the private judgment, which philosophic cant,
maudlin sentimentality, or fear of public opinion, may happen to
have forged, the man is a phenomenon, only less confused,
abnormal, suspicious than his biographers&rsquo; notions about
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again I say, I have not solved the problem: but
it will be enough if I make some think it both soluble and worth
solving.&nbsp; Let us look round, then, and see into what sort of
a country, into what sort of a world, the young adventurer is
going forth, at seventeen years of age, to seek his fortune.</p>
<p>Born in 1552, his young life has sprung up and grown with the
young life of England.&nbsp; The earliest fact, perhaps, which he
can recollect is the flash of joy on every face which proclaims
that Mary Tudor is dead, and Elizabeth reigns at last.&nbsp; As
he grows, the young man sees all the hope and adoration of the
English people centre in that wondrous maid, and his own centre
in her likewise.&nbsp; He had been base had he been
otherwise.&nbsp; She comes to the throne with such a prestige as
never sovereign came since the days when Isaiah sang his
p&aelig;an over young Hezekiah&rsquo;s accession.&nbsp; Young,
learned, witty, beautiful (as with such a father and mother she
could not help being), with an expression of countenance
remarkable (I speak of those early days) rather for its
tenderness and intellectual depth than its strength, she comes
forward as the champion of the Reformed Faith, the interpretress
of the will and conscience of the people of England&mdash;herself
persecuted all but to the death, and purified by affliction, like
gold tried in the fire.&nbsp; She gathers round her, one by one,
young men of promise, and trains them herself to their
work.&nbsp; And they fulfil it, and serve her, and grow
gray-headed in her service, working as faithfully, as
righteously, as patriotically, as men ever worked on earth.&nbsp;
They are her &lsquo;favourites&rsquo;; because they are men who
deserve favour; men who count not their own lives dear to
themselves for the sake of the queen and of that commonweal which
their hearts and reasons tell them is one with her.&nbsp; They
are still men, though; and some of them have their grudgings and
envyings against each other: she keeps the balance even between
them, on the whole, skilfully, gently, justly, in spite of
weaknesses and prejudices, without which she had been more than
human.&nbsp; Some have their conceited hopes of marrying her,
becoming her masters.&nbsp; She rebukes and pardons.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Out of the dust I took you, sir! go and do your duty,
humbly and rationally, henceforth, or into the dust I trample you
again!&rsquo;&nbsp; And they reconsider themselves, and
obey.&nbsp; But many, or most of them, are new men, country
gentlemen, and younger sons.&nbsp; She will follow her
father&rsquo;s plan, of keeping down the overgrown feudal
princes, who, though brought low by the wars of the Roses, are
still strong enough to throw everything into confusion by
resisting at once the Crown and Commons.&nbsp; Proud nobles reply
by rebellion, come down southwards with ignorant Popish henchmen
at their backs; will restore Popery, marry the Queen of Scots,
make the middle class and the majority submit to the feudal lords
and the minority.&nbsp; Elizabeth, with her &lsquo;aristocracy of
genius,&rsquo; is too strong for them: the people&rsquo;s heart
is with her, and not with dukes.&nbsp; Each mine only blows up
its diggers; and there are many dry eyes at their ruin.&nbsp; Her
people ask her to marry.&nbsp; She answers gently, proudly,
eloquently: &lsquo;She is married&mdash;the people of England is
her husband.&nbsp; She has vowed it.&rsquo;&nbsp; And yet there
is a tone of sadness in that great speech.&nbsp; Her
woman&rsquo;s heart yearns after love, after children; after a
strong bosom on which to repose that weary head.&nbsp; More than
once she is ready to give way.&nbsp; But she knows that it must
not be.&nbsp; She has her reward.&nbsp; &lsquo;Whosoever gives up
husband or child for my sake and the gospel&rsquo;s, shall
receive them back a hundredfold in this present life,&rsquo; as
Elizabeth does.&nbsp; Her reward is an adoration from high and
low, which is to us now inexplicable, impossible, overstrained,
which was not so then.</p>
<p>For the whole nation is in a mood of exaltation; England is
fairyland; the times are the last days&mdash;strange, terrible,
and glorious.&nbsp; At home are Jesuits plotting; dark,
crooked-pathed, going up and down in all manner of disguises,
doing the devil&rsquo;s work if men ever did it; trying to sow
discord between man and man, class and class; putting out books
full of filthy calumnies, declaring the queen illegitimate,
excommunicate, a usurper; English law null, and all state
appointments void, by virtue of a certain &lsquo;Bull&rsquo;; and
calling on the subjects to rebellion and assassination, even on
the bedchamber&mdash;woman to do to her &lsquo;as Judith did to
Holofernes.&rsquo;&nbsp; She answers by calm contempt.&nbsp; Now
and then Burleigh and Walsingham catch some of the rogues, and
they meet their deserts; but she for the most part lets them have
their way.&nbsp; God is on her side, and she will not fear what
man can do to her.</p>
<p>Abroad, the sky is dark and wild, and yet full of fantastic
splendour.&nbsp; Spain stands strong and awful, a rising
world-tyranny, with its dark-souled Cortezes and Pizarros, Alvas,
Don Johns, and Parmas, men whose path is like the lava stream;
who go forth slaying and to slay, in the name of their gods, like
those old Assyrian conquerors on the walls of Nineveh, with
tutelary genii flying above their heads, mingled with the eagles
who trail the entrails of the slain.&nbsp; By conquest,
intermarriage, or intrigue, she has made all the southern nations
her vassals or her tools; close to our own shores, the
Netherlands are struggling vainly for their liberties; abroad,
the Western Islands, and the whole trade of Africa and India,
will in a few years be hers.&nbsp; And already the Pope, whose
&lsquo;most Catholic&rsquo; and faithful servant she is, has
repaid her services in the cause of darkness by the gift of the
whole New World&mdash;a gift which she has claimed by cruelties
and massacres unexampled since the days of Timour and Zinghis
Khan.&nbsp; There she spreads and spreads, as Drake found her
picture in the Government House at St. Domingo, the horse leaping
through the globe, and underneath, <i>Non sufficit
orbis</i>.&nbsp; Who shall withstand her, armed as she is with
the three-edged sword of Antichrist&mdash;superstition, strength,
and gold?</p>
<p>English merchantmen, longing for some share in the riches of
the New World, go out to trade in Guinea, in the Azores, in New
Spain: and are answered by shot and steel.&nbsp; &lsquo;Both
policy and religion,&rsquo; as Fray Simon says, fifty years
afterwards, &lsquo;forbid Christians to trade with
heretics!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Lutheran devils, and enemies of
God,&rsquo; are the answer they get in words: in deeds, whenever
they have a superior force they may be allowed to land, and to
water their ships, even to trade, under exorbitant restrictions:
but generally this is merely a trap for them.&nbsp; Forces are
hurried up; and the English are attacked treacherously, in spite
of solemn compacts; for &lsquo;No faith need be kept with
heretics.&rsquo;&nbsp; And woe to them if any be taken prisoners,
even wrecked.&nbsp; The galleys, and the rack, and the stake are
their certain doom; for the Inquisition claims the bodies and
souls of heretics all over the world, and thinks it sin to lose
its own.&nbsp; A few years of such wrong raise questions in the
sturdy English heart.&nbsp; What right have these Spaniards to
the New World?&nbsp; The Pope&rsquo;s gift?&nbsp; Why, he gave it
by the same authority by which he claims the whole world.&nbsp;
The formula used when an Indian village is sacked is, that God
gave the whole world to St. Peter, and that he has given it to
his successors, and they the Indies to the King of Spain.&nbsp;
To acknowledge that lie would be to acknowledge the very power by
which the Pope claims a right to depose Queen Elizabeth, and give
her dominions to whomsoever he will.&nbsp; A fico for bulls!</p>
<p>By possession, then?&nbsp; That may hold for Mexico, Peru, New
Grenada, Paraguay, which have been colonised; though they were
gained by means which make every one concerned in conquering them
worthy of the gallows; and the right is only that of the thief to
the purse, whose owner he has murdered.&nbsp; But as for the
rest&mdash;Why the Spaniard has not colonised, even explored,
one-fifth of the New World, not even one-fifth of the
coast.&nbsp; Is the existence of a few petty factories, often
hundreds of miles apart, at a few river-mouths to give them a
claim to the whole intermediate coast, much less to the vast
unknown tracts inside?&nbsp; We will try that.&nbsp; If they
appeal to the sword, so be it.&nbsp; The men are treacherous
robbers; we will indemnify ourselves for our losses, and God
defend the right.</p>
<p>So argued the English; and so sprung up that strange war of
reprisals, in which, for eighteen years, it was held that there
was no peace between England and Spain beyond the line,
<i>i.e.</i>, beyond the parallel of longitude where the
Pope&rsquo;s gift of the western world was said to begin; and, as
the quarrel thickened and neared, extended to the Azores,
Canaries, and coasts of Africa, where English and Spaniards flew
at each other as soon as seen, mutually and by common consent, as
natural enemies, each invoking God in the battle with
Antichrist.</p>
<p>Into such a world as this goes forth young Raleigh, his heart
full of chivalrous worship for England&rsquo;s tutelary genius,
his brain aflame with the true miracles of the new-found
Hesperides, full of vague hopes, vast imaginations, and
consciousness of enormous power.&nbsp; And yet he is no wayward
dreamer, unfit for this work-day world.&nbsp; With a vein of song
&lsquo;most lofty, insolent, and passionate,&rsquo; indeed unable
to see aught without a poetic glow over the whole, he is
eminently practical, contented to begin at the beginning that he
may end at the end; one who could &lsquo;toil terribly,&rsquo;
&lsquo;who always laboured at the matter in hand as if he were
born only for that.&rsquo;&nbsp; Accordingly, he sets to work
faithfully and stoutly, to learn his trade of soldiering, and
learns it in silence and obscurity.&nbsp; He shares (it seems) in
the retreat at Moncontour, and is by at the death of
Cond&eacute;, and toils on for five years, marching and
skirmishing, smoking the enemy out of mountain-caves in
Languedoc, and all the wild work of war.&nbsp; During the San
Bartholomew massacre we hear nothing of him; perhaps he took
refuge with Sidney and others in Walsingham&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;
No records of these years remain, save a few scattered
reminiscences in his works, which mark the shrewd, observant eye
of the future statesman.</p>
<p>When he returned we know not.&nbsp; We trace him, in 1576, by
some verses prefixed to Gascoigne&rsquo;s satire, the
&lsquo;Steele Glass,&rsquo; solid, stately, epigrammatic,
&lsquo;by Walter Rawley of the Middle Temple.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
style is his; spelling of names matters nought in days in which a
man would spell his own name three different ways in one
document.</p>
<p>Gascoigne, like Raleigh, knew Lord Grey of Wilton, and most
men about town too; and had been a soldier abroad, like Raleigh,
probably with him.&nbsp; It seems to have been the fashion for
young idlers to lodge among the Templars; indeed, toward the end
of the century, they had to be cleared out, as crowding the wigs
and gowns too much; and perhaps proving noisy neighbours, as
Raleigh may have done.&nbsp; To this period may be referred,
probably, his Justice done on Mr. Charles Chester (Ben
Jonson&rsquo;s Carlo Buffone), &lsquo;a perpetual talker, and
made a noise like a drum in a room; so one time, at a tavern,
Raleigh beats him and seals up his mouth, his upper and nether
beard, with hard wax.&rsquo;&nbsp; For there is a great laugh in
Raleigh&rsquo;s heart, a genial contempt of asses; and one that
will make him enemies hereafter: perhaps shorten his days.</p>
<p>One hears of him next, but only by report, in the Netherlands
under Norris, where the nucleus of the English line (especially
of its musquetry) was training.&nbsp; For Don John of Austria
intends not only to crush the liberties and creeds of the
Flemings, but afterwards to marry the Queen of Scots, and conquer
England: and Elizabeth, unwillingly and slowly, for she cannot
stomach rebels, has sent men and money to the States to stop Don
John in time; which the valiant English and Scotch do on Lammas
day, 1578, and that in a fashion till then unseen in war.&nbsp;
For coming up late and panting, and &lsquo;being more sensible of
a little heat of the sun than of any cold fear of death,&rsquo;
they throw off their armour and clothes, and, in their shirts
(not over-clean, one fears), give Don John&rsquo;s rashness such
a rebuff, that two months more see that wild meteor, with lost
hopes and tarnished fame, lie down and vanish below the stormy
horizon.&nbsp; In these days, probably, it is that he knew
Colonel Bingham, a soldier of fortune, of a &lsquo;fancy high and
wild, too desultory and over-voluble,&rsquo; who had, among his
hundred and one schemes, one for the plantation of America as
poor Sir Thomas Stukely (whom Raleigh must have known well),
uncle of the traitor Lewis, had for the peopling of Florida.</p>
<p>Raleigh returns.&nbsp; Ten years has he been learning his
soldier&rsquo;s trade in silence.&nbsp; He will take a lesson in
seamanship next.&nbsp; The court may come in time: for by now the
poor squire&rsquo;s younger son must have
discovered&mdash;perhaps even too fully&mdash;that he is not as
other men are; that he can speak, and watch, and dare, and
endure, as none around him can do.&nbsp; However, there are
&lsquo;good adventures toward,&rsquo; as the &lsquo;Morte
d&rsquo;Arthur&rsquo; would say; and he will off with his
half-brother Humphrey Gilbert to carry out his patent for
planting <i>Meta Incognita</i>&mdash;&lsquo;The Unknown
Goal,&rsquo; as Queen Elizabeth has named it&mdash;which will
prove to be too truly and fatally unknown.&nbsp; In a latitude
south of England, and with an Italian summer, who can guess that
the winter will outfreeze Russia itself?&nbsp; The
merchant-seaman, like the statesman, had yet many a thing to
learn.&nbsp; Instead of smiling at our forefathers&rsquo;
ignorance, let us honour the men who bought knowledge for us
their children at the price of lives nobler than our own.</p>
<p>So Raleigh goes on his voyage with Humphrey Gilbert, to carry
out the patent for discovering and planting in <i>Meta
Incognita</i>; but the voyage prospers not.&nbsp; A &lsquo;smart
brush with the Spaniards&rsquo; sends them home again, with the
loss of Morgan, their best captain, and &lsquo;a tall
ship&rsquo;; and <i>Meta Incognita</i> is forgotten for a while;
but not the Spaniards.&nbsp; Who are these who forbid all
English, by virtue of the Pope&rsquo;s bull, to cross the
Atlantic?&nbsp; That must be settled hereafter; and Raleigh, ever
busy, is off to Ireland to command a company in that
&lsquo;common weal, or rather common woe&rsquo;, as he calls it
in a letter to Leicester.&nbsp; Two years and more pass here; and
all the records of him which remain are of a man valiant, daring,
and yet prudent beyond his fellows.&nbsp; He hates his work, and
is not on too good terms with stern and sour, but brave and
faithful Lord Grey; but Lord Grey is Leicester&rsquo;s friend,
and Raleigh works patiently under him, like a sensible man, just
because he is Leicester&rsquo;s friend.&nbsp; Some modern
gentleman of note&mdash;I forget who, and do not care to
recollect&mdash;says that Raleigh&rsquo;s &lsquo;prudence never
bore any proportion to his genius.&rsquo;&nbsp; The next
biographer we open accuses him of being too calculating, cunning,
timeserving; and so forth.&nbsp; Perhaps both are true.&nbsp; The
man&rsquo;s was a character very likely to fall alternately into
either sin&mdash;doubtless did so a hundred times.&nbsp; Perhaps
both are false.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s character was, on occasion,
certain to rise above both faults.&nbsp; We have evidence that he
did so his whole life long.</p>
<p>He is tired of Ireland at last: nothing goes right
there:&mdash;When has it?&nbsp; Nothing is to be done
there.&nbsp; That which is crooked cannot be made straight, and
that which is wanting cannot be numbered.&nbsp; He comes to
London and to court.&nbsp; But how?&nbsp; By spreading his cloak
over a muddy place for Queen Elizabeth to step on?&nbsp; It is
very likely to be a true story; but biographers have slurred over
a few facts in their hurry to carry out their theory of
&lsquo;favourites,&rsquo; and to prove that Elizabeth took up
Raleigh on the same grounds that a boarding-school miss might
have done.&nbsp; Not that I deny the cloak story to be a very
pretty story; perhaps it justifies, taken alone,
Elizabeth&rsquo;s fondness for him.&nbsp; There may have been
self-interest in it; we are bound, as &lsquo;men of the
world,&rsquo; to impute the dirtiest motive that we can find; but
how many self-interested men do we know who would have had
quickness and daring to do such a thing?&nbsp; Men who are
thinking about themselves are not generally either so
quick-witted, or so inclined to throw away a good cloak, when by
much scraping and saving they have got one.&nbsp; I never met a
cunning, selfish, ambitious man who would have done such a
thing.&nbsp; The reader may; but even if he has, we must ask him,
for Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s sake, to consider that this young
Quixote is the close relation of three of the finest public men
then living, Champernoun, Gilbert, and Carew.&nbsp; That he is a
friend of Sidney, a pet of Leicester; that he has left behind him
at Oxford, and brought with him from Ireland, the reputation of
being a <i>rara avis</i>, a new star in the firmament; that he
had been a soldier in her Majesty&rsquo;s service (and in one in
which she has a peculiar private interest) for twelve years; that
he has held her commission as one of the triumvirate for
governing Munster, and has been the commander of the garrison at
Cork; and that it is possible that she may have heard something
of him before he threw his cloak under her feet, especially as
there has been some controversy (which we have in vain tried to
fathom) between him and Lord Grey about that terrible Smerwick
slaughter; of the results of which we know little, but that
Raleigh, being called in question about it in London, made such
good play with his tongue, that his reputation as an orator and a
man of talent was fixed once and for ever.</p>
<p>Within the twelve months he is sent on some secret diplomatic
mission about the Anjou marriage; he is in fact now installed in
his place as &lsquo;a favourite.&rsquo;&nbsp; And why not?&nbsp;
If a man is found to be wise and witty, ready and useful, able to
do whatsoever he is put to, why is a sovereign, who has eyes to
see the man&rsquo;s worth and courage to use it, to be accused of
I know not what, because the said man happens to be
good-looking?</p>
<p>Now comes the turning-point of Raleigh&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;
What does he intend to be?&nbsp; Soldier, statesman, scholar, or
sea-adventurer?&nbsp; He takes the most natural, yet not the
wisest course.&nbsp; He will try and be all four at once.&nbsp;
He has intellect for it; by worldly wisdom he may have money for
it also.&nbsp; Even now he has contrived (no one can tell whence)
to build a good bark of two hundred tons, and send her out with
Humphrey Gilbert on his second and fatal voyage.&nbsp; Luckily
for Raleigh she deserts and comes home, while not yet out of the
Channel, or she surely had gone the way of the rest of
Gilbert&rsquo;s squadron.&nbsp; Raleigh, of course, loses money
by the failure, as well as the hopes which he had grounded on his
brother&rsquo;s Transatlantic viceroyalty.&nbsp; And a bitter
pang it must have been to him to find himself bereft of that pure
and heroic counsellor just at his entering into life.&nbsp; But
with the same elasticity which sent him to the grave, he is busy
within six months in a fresh expedition.&nbsp; If <i>Meta
Incognita</i> be not worth planting, there must be, so Raleigh
thinks, a vast extent of coast between it and Florida, which is
more genial in climate, perhaps more rich in produce; and he
sends Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlow to look for the same, and
not in vain.</p>
<p>On these Virginian discoveries I shall say but little.&nbsp;
Those who wish to enjoy them should read them in all their naive
freshness in the originals; and they will subscribe to S. T.
Coleridge&rsquo;s dictum, that no one nowadays can write travels
as well as the old worthies who figure in Hakluyt and
Purchas.</p>
<p>But to return to the question&mdash;What does this man intend
to be?&nbsp; A discoverer and colonist; a vindicator of some part
at least of America from Spanish claims?&nbsp; Perhaps not
altogether: else he would have gone himself to Virginia, at least
the second voyage, instead of sending others.&nbsp; But here, it
seems, is the fatal, and yet pardonable mistake, which haunts the
man throughout.&nbsp; He tries to be too many men at once.&nbsp;
Fatal: because, though he leaves his trace on more things than
one man is wont to do, he, strictly speaking, conquers nothing,
brings nothing to a consummation.&nbsp; Virginia, Guiana, the
&lsquo;History of the World,&rsquo; his own career as a
statesman&mdash;as dictator (for he might have been dictator had
he chosen)&mdash;all are left unfinished.&nbsp; And yet most
pardonable; for if a man feels that he can do many different
things, how hard to teach himself that he must not do them
all!&nbsp; How hard to say to himself, &lsquo;I must cut off the
right hand, and pluck out the right eye.&nbsp; I must be less
than myself, in order really to be anything.&nbsp; I must
concentrate my powers on one subject, and that perhaps by no
means the most seemingly noble or useful, still less the most
pleasant, and forego so many branches of activity in which I
might be so distinguished, so useful.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is a hard
lesson.&nbsp; Raleigh took just sixty-six years learning it; and
had to carry the result of his experience to the other side of
the dark river, for there was no time left to use it on this
side.&nbsp; Some readers may have learnt the lesson
already.&nbsp; If so, happy and blessed are they.&nbsp; But let
them not therefore exalt themselves above Walter Raleigh; for
that lesson is, of course, soonest learnt by the man who can
excel in few things, later by him who can excel in many, and
latest of all by him who, like Raleigh, can excel in all.</p>
<p>Few details remain concerning the earlier court days of
Raleigh.&nbsp; He rises rapidly, as we have seen.&nbsp; He has an
estate given him in Ireland, near his friend Spenser, where he
tries to do well and wisely, colonising, tilling, and planting
it: but like his Virginia expeditions, principally at second
hand.&nbsp; For he has swallowed (there is no denying it) the
painted bait.&nbsp; He will discover, he will colonise, he will
do all manner of beautiful things, at second hand: but he himself
will be a courtier.&nbsp; It is very tempting.&nbsp; Who would
not, at the age of thirty, have wished to have been one of that
chosen band of geniuses and heroes whom Elizabeth had gathered
round her?&nbsp; Who would not, at the age of thirty, have given
his pound of flesh to be captain of her guard, and to go with her
whithersoever she went?&nbsp; It is not merely the intense
gratification to carnal vanity&mdash;which if any man denies or
scoffs at, always mark him down as especially guilty&mdash;which
is to be considered; but the real, actual honour, in the mind of
one who looked on Elizabeth as the most precious and glorious
being which the earth had seen for centuries.&nbsp; To be
appreciated by her; to be loved by her; to serve her; to guard
her; what could man desire more on earth?</p>
<p>Beside, he becomes a member of Parliament now; Lord Warden of
the Stannaries; business which of course keeps him in England,
business which he performs, as he does all things, wisely and
well.&nbsp; Such a generation as this ought really to respect
Raleigh a little more, if it be only for his excellence in their
own especial sphere&mdash;that of business.&nbsp; Raleigh is a
thorough man of business.&nbsp; He can &lsquo;toil
terribly,&rsquo; and what is more, toil to the purpose.&nbsp; In
all the everyday affairs of life, he remains without a blot; a
diligent, methodical, prudent man, who, though he plays for great
stakes, ventures and loses his whole fortune again and again, yet
never seems to omit the &lsquo;doing the duty which lies nearest
him&rsquo;; never gets into mean money scrapes; never neglects
tenants or duty; never gives way for one instant to &lsquo;the
eccentricities of genius.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If he had done so, be sure that we should have heard of
it.&nbsp; For no man can become what he has become without making
many an enemy; and he has his enemies already.&nbsp; On which
statement naturally occurs the question&mdash;why?&nbsp; An
important question too; because several of his later biographers
seem to have running in their minds some such train of thought as
this&mdash;Raleigh must have been a bad fellow, or he would not
have had so many enemies; and because he was a bad fellow, there
is an <i>&agrave; priori</i> reason that charges against him are
true.&nbsp; Whether this be arguing in a circle or not, it is
worth searching out the beginning of this enmity, and the reputed
causes of it.&nbsp; In after years it will be because he is
&lsquo;damnable proud,&rsquo; because he hated Essex, and so
forth: of which in their places.&nbsp; But what is the earliest
count against him?&nbsp; Naunton, who hated Raleigh, and was
moreover a rogue, has no reason to give, but that &lsquo;the
Queen took him for a kind of oracle, which much nettled them all;
yea, those he relied on began to take this his sudden favour for
an alarm; to be sensible of their own supplantation, and to
project his; which shortly made him to sing, &ldquo;Fortune my
foe.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, be this true or not, and we do not put much faith in it,
it gives no reason for the early dislike of Raleigh, save the
somewhat unsatisfactory one which Cain would have given for his
dislike of Abel.&nbsp; Moreover, there exists a letter of
Essex&rsquo;s, written as thoroughly in the Cain spirit as any we
ever read; and we wonder that, after reading that letter, men can
find courage to repeat the old sentimentalism about the
&lsquo;noble and unfortunate&rsquo; Earl.&nbsp; His hatred of
Raleigh&mdash;which, as we shall see hereafter, Raleigh not only
bears patiently, but requites with good deeds as long as he
can&mdash;springs, by his own confession, simply from envy and
disappointed vanity.&nbsp; The spoilt boy insults Queen Elizabeth
about her liking for the &lsquo;knave Raleigh.&rsquo;&nbsp; She,
&lsquo;taking hold of one word disdain,&rsquo; tells Essex that
&lsquo;there was no such cause why I should thus disdain
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; On which, says Essex, &lsquo;as near as I could
I did describe unto her what he had been, and what he was; and
then I did let her see, whether I had come to disdain his
competition of love, or whether I could have comfort to give
myself over to the service of a mistress that was in awe of such
a man.&nbsp; I spake for grief and choler as much against him as
I could: and I think he standing at the door might very well hear
the worst that I spoke of him.&nbsp; In the end, I saw she was
resolved to defend him, and to cross me.&rsquo;&nbsp; Whereupon
follows a &lsquo;scene,&rsquo; the naughty boy raging and
stamping, till he insults the Queen, and calls Raleigh &lsquo;a
wretch&rsquo;; whereon poor Elizabeth, who loved the coxcomb for
his father&rsquo;s sake, &lsquo;turned her away to my Lady
Warwick,&rsquo; and Essex goes grumbling forth.</p>
<p>Raleigh&rsquo;s next few years are brilliant and busy ones;
and gladly, did space permit, would I give details of those
brilliant adventures which make this part of his life that of a
true knight-errant.&nbsp; But they are mere episodes in the
history; and we must pass them quickly by, only saying that they
corroborate in all things our original notion of the
man&mdash;just, humane, wise, greatly daring and enduring
greatly; and filled with the one fixed idea, which has grown with
his growth and strengthened with his strength, the destruction of
the Spanish power, and colonisation of America by English.&nbsp;
His brother Humphrey makes a second attempt to colonise
Newfoundland, and perishes as heroically as he had lived.&nbsp;
Raleigh, undaunted by his own loss in the adventure and his
brother&rsquo;s failure, sends out a fleet of his own to discover
to the southward, and finds Virginia.&nbsp; One might spend pages
on this beautiful episode; on the simple descriptions of the fair
new land which the sea-kings bring home; on the profound (for
those times at least) knowledge which prompted Raleigh to make
the attempt in that particular direction which had as yet escaped
the notice of the Spaniards; on the quiet patience with which,
undaunted by the ill-success of the first colonists, he sends out
fleet after fleet, to keep the hold which he had once gained;
till, unable any longer to support the huge expense, he makes
over his patent for discovery to a company of merchants, who fare
for many years as ill as Raleigh himself did: but one thing one
has a right to say, that to this one man, under the providence of
Almighty God, do the whole of the United States of America owe
their existence.&nbsp; The work was double.&nbsp; The colony,
however small, had to be kept in possession at all hazards; and
he did it.&nbsp; But that was not enough.&nbsp; Spain must be
prevented from extending her operations northward from Florida;
she must be crippled along the whole east coast of America.&nbsp;
And Raleigh did that too.&nbsp; We find him for years to come a
part-adventurer in almost every attack on the Spaniards: we find
him preaching war against them on these very grounds, and setting
others to preach it also.&nbsp; Good old Hariot (Raleigh&rsquo;s
mathematical tutor, whom he sent to Virginia) re-echoes his
pupil&rsquo;s trumpet-blast.&nbsp; Hooker, in his epistle
dedicatory of his Irish History, strikes the same note, and a
right noble one it is.&nbsp; &lsquo;These Spaniards are trying to
build up a world-tyranny by rapine and cruelty.&nbsp; You, sir,
call on us to deliver the earth from them, by doing justly and
loving mercy; and we will obey you!&rsquo; is the answer which
Raleigh receives, as far as I can find, from every nobler-natured
Englishman.</p>
<p>It was an immense conception: a glorious one: it stood out so
clear: there was no mistake about its being the absolutely right,
wise, patriotic thing; and so feasible, too, if Raleigh could but
find &lsquo;<i>six cents hommes qui savaient
mourir</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; But that was just what he could not
find.&nbsp; He could draw round him, and did, by the spiritual
magnetism of his genius, many a noble soul; but he could not
organise them, as he seems to have tried to do, into a coherent
body.&nbsp; The English spirit of independent action, never
stronger than in that age, and most wisely encouraged, for other
reasons, by good Queen Bess, was too strong for him.&nbsp; His
pupils will &lsquo;fight on their own hook&rsquo; like so many
Yankee rangers: quarrel with each other: grumble at him.&nbsp;
For the truth is, he demands of them too high a standard of
thought and purpose.&nbsp; He is often a whole heaven above them
in the hugeness of his imagination, the nobleness of his motive;
and Don Quixote can often find no better squire than Sancho
Panza.&nbsp; Even glorious Sir Richard Grenvile makes a mistake:
burns an Indian village because they steal a silver cup; throws
back the colonisation of Virginia ten years with his over-strict
notions of discipline and retributive justice; and Raleigh
requites him for his offence by embalming him, his valour and his
death, not in immortal verse, but in immortal prose.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;True Relation of the Fight at the Azores&rsquo; gives the
keynote of Raleigh&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; If readers will not take
that as the text on which his whole life is a commentary they may
know a great deal about him, but him they will never know.</p>
<p>The game becomes fiercer and fiercer.&nbsp; Blow and
counterblow between the Spanish king, for the whole West-Indian
commerce was a government job, and the merchant nobles of
England.&nbsp; At last the Great Armada comes, and the Great
Armada goes again.&nbsp; <i>Venit</i>, <i>vidit</i>,
<i>fugit</i>, as the medals said of it.&nbsp; And to Walter
Raleigh&rsquo;s counsel, by the testimony of all contemporaries,
the mighty victory is to be principally attributed.&nbsp; Where
all men did heroically, it were invidious to bestow on him alone
a crown, <i>ob patriam servatam</i>.&nbsp; But henceforth,
Elizabeth knows well that she has not been mistaken in her
choice; and Raleigh is better loved than ever, heaped with fresh
wealth and honours.&nbsp; And who deserves them better?</p>
<p>The immense value of his services in the defence of England
should excuse him from the complaint which one has been often
inclined to bring against him,&mdash;Why, instead of sending
others Westward Ho, did be not go himself?&nbsp; Surely he could
have reconciled the jarring instruments with which he was
working.&nbsp; He could have organised such a body of men as
perhaps never went out before or since on the same errand.&nbsp;
He could have done all that Cortez did, and more; and done it
more justly and mercifully.</p>
<p>True.&nbsp; And here seems (as far as little folk dare judge
great folk) to have been Raleigh&rsquo;s mistake.&nbsp; He is too
wide for real success.&nbsp; He has too many plans; he is fond of
too many pursuits.&nbsp; The man who succeeds is generally the
narrow mall; the man of one idea, who works at nothing but that;
sees everything only through the light of that; sacrifices
everything to that: the fanatic, in short.&nbsp; By fanatics,
whether military, commercial, or religious, and not by
&lsquo;liberal-minded men&rsquo; at all, has the world&rsquo;s
work been done in all ages.&nbsp; Amid the modern cants, one of
the most mistaken is the cant about the &lsquo;mission of
genius,&rsquo; the &lsquo;mission of the poet.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Poets, we hear in some quarters, are the anointed kings of
mankind&mdash;at least, so the little poets sing, each to his
little fiddle.&nbsp; There is no greater mistake.&nbsp; It is the
practical, prosaical fanatic who does the work; and the poet, if
he tries to do it, is certain to put down his spade every five
minutes, to look at the prospect, and pick flowers, and moralise
on dead asses, till he ends a <i>N&eacute;ron malgr&eacute;
lui-m&ecirc;me</i>, fiddling melodiously while Rome is
burning.&nbsp; And perhaps this is the secret of Raleigh&rsquo;s
failure.&nbsp; He is a fanatic, no doubt, a true knight-errant:
but he is too much of a poet withal.&nbsp; The sense of beauty
enthrals him at every step.&nbsp; Gloriana&rsquo;s fairy court,
with its chivalries and its euphuisms, its masques and its
tourneys, and he the most charming personage in it, are too
charming for him&mdash;as they would have been for us, reader:
and he cannot give them up and go about the one work.&nbsp; He
justifies his double-mindedness to himself, no doubt, as he does
to the world, by working wisely, indefatigably, and bravely: but
still he has put his trust in princes, and in the children of
men.&nbsp; His sin, as far as we can see, is not against man, but
against God; one which we do not nowadays call a sin, but a
weakness.&nbsp; Be it so.&nbsp; God punished him for it, swiftly
and sharply; which I hold to be a sure sign that God also forgave
him for it.</p>
<p>So he stays at home, spends, sooner or later, &pound;40,000 on
Virginia, writes charming court-poetry with Oxford, Buckhurst,
and Paget, brings over Spenser from Ireland and introduces Colin
Clout to Gloriana, who loves&mdash;as who would not have
loved?&mdash;that most beautiful of faces and of souls; helps
poor puritan Udall out of his scrape as far as he can; begs for
Captain Spring, begs for many more, whose names are only known by
being connected with some good deed of his.&nbsp; &lsquo;When,
Sir Walter,&rsquo; asks Queen Bess, &lsquo;will you cease to be a
beggar?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;When your Majesty ceases to be a
benefactor.&rsquo;&nbsp; Perhaps it is in these days that he set
up his &lsquo;office of address&rsquo;&mdash;some sort of agency
for discovering and relieving the wants of worthy men.&nbsp; So
all seems to go well.&nbsp; If he has lost in Virginia, he has
gained by Spanish prizes; his wine-patent is bringing him in a
large revenue, and the heavens smile on him.&nbsp; Thou sayest,
&lsquo;I am rich and increased in goods, and have need of
nothing; and knowest not that thou art poor and miserable and
blind and naked.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thou shalt learn it, then, and pay
dearly for thy lesson.</p>
<p>For, in the meanwhile, Raleigh falls into a very great sin,
for which, as usual with his elect, God inflicts swift and
instant punishment; on which, as usual, biographers talk much
unwisdom.&nbsp; He seduces Miss Throgmorton, one of the maids of
honour.&nbsp; Elizabeth is very wroth; and had she not good
reason to be wroth?&nbsp; Is it either fair or reasonable to talk
of her &lsquo;demanding a monopoly of love,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;being incensed at the temerity of her favourite, in
presuming to fall in love and marry without her
consent?&rsquo;&nbsp; Away with such cant.&nbsp; The plain facts
are: that a man nearly forty years old abuses his wonderful gifts
of body and mind, to ruin a girl nearly twenty years younger than
himself.&nbsp; What wonder if a virtuous woman&mdash;and Queen
Elizabeth was virtuous&mdash;thought it a base deed, and punished
it accordingly?&nbsp; There is no more to be discovered in the
matter, save by the vulturine nose which smells carrion in every
rose-bed.&nbsp; Raleigh has a great attempt on the Plate-fleets
in hand; he hurries off from Chatham, and writes to young Cecil
on the 10th of March, &lsquo;I mean not to come away, as some say
I will, for fear of a marriage, and I know not what . . . For I
protest before God, there is none on the face of the earth that I
would be fastened unto.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This famous passage is one of those over which the virtuosity
of modern times, rejoicing in evil, has hung so fondly, as giving
melancholy proof of the &lsquo;duplicity of Raleigh&rsquo;s
character&rsquo;; as if a man who once in his life had told an
untruth was proved by that fact to be a rogue from birth to
death: while others have kindly given him the benefit of a doubt
whether the letter were not written after a private marriage, and
therefore Raleigh, being &lsquo;joined unto&rsquo; some one
already, had a right to say that he did not wish to be joined to
any one.&nbsp; But I do not concur in this doubt.&nbsp; Four
months after, Sir Edward Stafford writes to Anthony Bacon,
&lsquo;If you have anything to do with Sir W. R., or any love to
make to Mistress Throgmorton, at the Tower to-morrow you may
speak with them.&rsquo;&nbsp; This implies that no marriage had
yet taken place.&nbsp; And surely, if there had been private
marriage, two people who were about to be sent to the Tower for
their folly would have made the marriage public at once, as the
only possible self-justification.&nbsp; But it is a pity, in my
opinion, that biographers, before pronouncing upon that supposed
lie of Raleigh&rsquo;s, had not taken the trouble to find out
what the words mean.&nbsp; In their virtuous haste to prove him a
liar, they have overlooked the fact that the words, as they
stand, are unintelligible, and the argument
self-contradictory.&nbsp; He wants to prove, we suppose, that he
does not go to sea for fear of being forced to marry Miss
Throgmorton.&nbsp; It is, at least, an unexpected method of so
doing in a shrewd man like Raleigh, to say that he wishes to
marry no one at all.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t think that I run
away for fear of a marriage, for I do not wish to marry any one
on the face of the earth,&rsquo; is a speech which may prove
Raleigh to have been a fool, and we must understand it before we
can say that it proves him a rogue.&nbsp; If we had received such
a letter from a friend, we should have said at once, &lsquo;Why
the man, in his hurry and confusion, has omitted <i>the</i> word;
he must have meant to write, not &ldquo;There is none on the face
of the earth that I would be fastened to,&rdquo; but &ldquo;There
is none on the face of the earth that I would <i>rather</i> be
fastened to,&rdquo;&lsquo; which would at once make sense and
suit fact.&nbsp; For Raleigh not only married Miss Throgmorton
forthwith, but made her the best of husbands.&nbsp; My
conjectural emendation may go for what it is worth: but that the
passage, as it stands in Murdin&rsquo;s State Papers (the MSS. I
have not seen) is either misquoted, or mis-written by Raleigh
himself, I cannot doubt.&nbsp; He was not one to think nonsense,
even if he scribbled it.</p>
<p>The Spanish raid turns out well.&nbsp; Raleigh overlooks
Elizabeth&rsquo;s letters of recall till he finds out that the
King of Spain has stopped the Plate-fleet for fear of his coming;
and then returns, sending on Sir John Burrough to the Azores,
where he takes the &lsquo;Great Carack,&rsquo; the largest prize
(1600 tons) which had ever been brought into England.&nbsp; The
details of that gallant fight stand in the pages of
Hakluyt.&nbsp; It raised Raleigh once more to wealth, though not
to favour.&nbsp; Shortly after he returns from the sea, he finds
himself, where he deserves to be, in the Tower, where he does
more than one thing which brought him no credit.&nbsp; How far we
are justified in calling his quarrel with Sir George Carew, his
keeper, for not letting him &lsquo;disguise himself, and get into
a pair of oars to ease his mind but with a sight of the Queen, or
his heart would break,&rsquo; hypocrisy, is a very different
matter.&nbsp; Honest Arthur Gorges, a staunch friend of
Raleigh&rsquo;s, tells the story laughingly and lovingly, as if
he thought Raleigh sincere, but somewhat mad: and yet honest
Gorges has a good right to say a bitter thing; for after having
been &lsquo;ready to break with laughing at seeing them two brawl
and scramble like madmen, and Sir George&rsquo;s new periwig torn
off his crown,&rsquo; he sees &lsquo;the iron walking&rsquo; and
daggers out, and playing the part of him who taketh a dog by the
ears, &lsquo;purchased such a rap on the knuckles, that I wished
both their pates broken, and so with much ado they staid their
brawl to see my bloody fingers,&rsquo; and then set to work to
abuse the hapless peacemaker.&nbsp; After which things Raleigh
writes a letter to Cecil, which is still more offensive in the
eyes of virtuous biographers&mdash;how &lsquo;his heart was never
broken till this day, when he hears the Queen goes so far off,
whom he followed with love and desire on so many journeys, and am
now left behind in a dark prison all alone.&rsquo; . . . &lsquo;I
that was wont to behold her riding like Alexander, hunting like
Diana, walking like Venus, the gentle wind blowing her fair hair
about her pure cheeks,&rsquo; and so forth, in a style in which
the vulturine nose must needs scent carrion, just because the
roses are more fragrant than they should be in a world where all
ought to be either vultures or carrion for their dinners.&nbsp;
As for his despair, had he not good reason to be in
despair?&nbsp; By his own sin he has hurled himself down the hill
which he has so painfully climbed.&nbsp; He is in the
Tower&mdash;surely no pleasant or hopeful place for any
man.&nbsp; Elizabeth is exceedingly wroth with him; and what is
worse, he deserves what he has got.&nbsp; His whole fortune is
ventured in an expedition over which he has no control, which has
been unsuccessful in its first object, and which may be
altogether unsuccessful in that which it has undertaken as a
<i>pis-aller</i>, and so leave him penniless.&nbsp; There want
not, too, those who will trample on the fallen.&nbsp; The deputy
has been cruelly distraining on his Irish tenants for a
&lsquo;supposed debt of his to the Queen of &pound;400 for
rent,&rsquo; which was indeed but fifty marks, and which was
paid, and has carried off 500 milch kine from the poor settlers
whom he has planted there, and forcibly thrust him out of
possession of a castle.&nbsp; Moreover, the whole Irish estates
are likely to come to ruin; for nothing prevails but rascality
among the English soldiers, impotence among the governors, and
rebellion among the natives.&nbsp; Three thousand Burkes are up
in arms; his &lsquo;prophecy of this rebellion&rsquo; ten days
ago was laughed at, and now has come true; and altogether, Walter
Raleigh and all belonging to him is in as evil case as he ever
was on earth.&nbsp; No wonder, poor fellow, if he behowls himself
lustily, and not always wisely, to Cecil, and every one else who
will listen to him.</p>
<p>As for his fine speeches about Elizabeth, why forget the
standing-point from which such speeches were made?&nbsp; Over and
above his present ruin, it was (and ought to have been) an
utterly horrible and unbearable thing to Raleigh, or any man, to
have fallen into disgrace with Elizabeth by his own fault.&nbsp;
He feels (and perhaps rightly) that he is as it were
excommunicated from England, and the mission and the glory of
England.&nbsp; Instead of being, as he was till now, one of a
body of brave men working together in one great common cause, he
has cut himself off from the congregation by his own selfish
lust, and there he is left alone with his shame.&nbsp; We must
try to realise to ourselves the way in which such men as Raleigh
looked not only at Elizabeth, but at all the world.&nbsp; There
was, in plain palpable fact, something about the Queen, her
history, her policy, the times, the glorious part which England,
and she as the incarnation of the then English spirit, were
playing upon earth, which raised imaginative and heroical souls
into a permanent exaltation&mdash;a &lsquo;fairyland,&rsquo; as
they called it themselves, which seems to us fantastic, and would
be fantastic in us, because we are not at their work, or in their
days.&nbsp; There can be no doubt that a number of as noble men
as ever stood together on the earth did worship that woman, fight
for her, toil for her, risk all for her, with a pure chivalrous
affection which has furnished one of the most beautiful pages in
all the book of history.&nbsp; Blots there must needs have been,
and inconsistencies, selfishnesses, follies; for they too were
men of like passions with ourselves; but let us look at the fair
vision as a whole, and thank God that such a thing has for once
existed even imperfectly on this sinful earth, instead of playing
the part of Ham and falling under his curse,&mdash;the penalty of
slavishness, cowardice, loss of noble daring, which surely falls
on any generation which is &lsquo;banausos,&rsquo; to use
Aristotle&rsquo;s word; which rejoices in its forefathers&rsquo;
shame, and, unable to believe in the nobleness of others, is
unable to become noble itself.</p>
<p>As for the &lsquo;Alexander and Diana&rsquo; affectations,
they were the language of the time: and certainly this generation
has no reason to find fault with them, or with a good deal more
of the &lsquo;affectations&rsquo; and &lsquo;flattery&rsquo; of
Elizabethan times, while it listens complacently night after
night &lsquo;to honourable members&rsquo; complimenting not Queen
Elizabeth, but Sir Jabesh Windbag, Fiddle, Faddle, Red-tape, and
party with protestations of deepest respect and fullest
confidence in the very speeches in which they bring accusations
of every offence short of high treason&mdash;to be understood, of
course, in a &lsquo;parliamentary sense,&rsquo; as Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s were in a &lsquo;Pickwickian&rsquo; one.&nbsp;
If a generation of Knoxes and Mortons, Burleighs and Raleighs,
shall ever arise again, one wonders by what name they will call
the parliamentary morality and parliamentary courtesy of a
generation which has meted out such measure to their
ancestors&rsquo; failings?</p>
<p>&lsquo;But Queen Elizabeth was an old woman then.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I thank the objector even for that &lsquo;then&rsquo;; for it is
much nowadays to find any one who believes that Queen Elizabeth
was ever young, or who does not talk of her as if she was born
about seventy years of age covered with rouge and wrinkles.&nbsp;
I will undertake to say that as to the beauty of this woman there
is a greater mass of testimony, and from the very best judges
too, than there is of the beauty of any personage in history; and
yet it has become the fashion now to deny even that.&nbsp; The
plain facts seem that she was very graceful, active, accomplished
in all outward manners, of a perfect figure, and of that style of
intellectual beauty, depending on expression, which attracted
(and we trust always will attract) Britons far more than that
merely sensuous loveliness in which no doubt Mary Stuart far
surpassed her.&nbsp; And there seems little doubt that, like many
Englishwomen, she retained her beauty to a very late period in
life, not to mention that she was, in 1592, just at that age of
rejuvenescence which makes many a woman more lovely at sixty than
she has been since she was thirty-five.&nbsp; No doubt, too, she
used every artificial means to preserve her famous complexion;
and quite right she was.&nbsp; This beauty of hers had been a
talent, as all beauty is, committed to her by God; it had been an
important element in her great success; men had accepted it as
what beauty of form and expression generally is, an outward and
visible sign of the inward and spiritual grace; and while the
inward was unchanged, what wonder if she tried to preserve the
outward?&nbsp; If she was the same, why should she not try to
look the same?&nbsp; And what blame to those who worshipped her,
if, knowing that she was the same, they too should fancy that she
looked the same, the Elizabeth of their youth, and should talk as
if the fair flesh, as well as the fair spirit, was
immortal?&nbsp; Does not every loving husband do so when he
forgets the gray hair and the sunken cheek, and all the wastes of
time, and sees the partner of many joys and sorrows not as she
has become, but as she was, ay, and is to him, and will be to
him, he trusts, through all eternity?&nbsp; There is no feeling
in these Elizabethan worshippers which we have not seen,
potential and crude, again and again in the best and noblest of
young men whom we have met, till it was crushed in them by the
luxury, effeminacy, and unbelief in chivalry, which are the sure
accompaniment of a long peace, which war may burn up with
beneficent fire.</p>
<p>But we must hasten on now; for Raleigh is out of prison in
September, and by the next spring in parliament speaking wisely
and well, especially on his fixed idea, war with Spain, which he
is rewarded for forthwith in Father Parson&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Andre&aelig; Philopatris Responsio&rsquo; by a charge of
founding a school of Atheism for the corruption of young
gentlemen; a charge which Lord Chief-Justice Popham, Protestant
as he is, will find it useful one day to recollect.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, however, now that Raleigh has married the fair
Throgmorton and done wisely in other matters, restores him to
favour.&nbsp; If he has sinned, he has suffered: but he is as
useful as ever, now that his senses have returned to him; and he
is making good speeches in parliament, instead of bad ones to
weak maidens; so we find him once more in favour, and possessor
of Sherborne Manor, where he builds and beautifies, with
&lsquo;groves and gardens of much variety and great
delight.&rsquo;&nbsp; And God, too, seems to have forgiven him;
perhaps has forgiven; for there the fair Throgmorton brings him a
noble boy.&nbsp; <i>Ut sis vitalis metuo puer</i>!</p>
<p>Raleigh will quote David&rsquo;s example one day, not wisely
or well.&nbsp; Does David&rsquo;s example ever cross him now, and
those sad words,&mdash;&lsquo;The Lord hath put away thy sin, . .
. nevertheless the child that is born unto thee shall
die?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Let that be as it may, all is sunshine once more.&nbsp;
Sherborne Manor, a rich share in the great carack, a beautiful
wife, a child; what more does this man want to make him
happy?&nbsp; Why should he not settle down upon his lees, like
ninety-nine out of the hundred, or at least try a peaceful and
easy path toward more &lsquo;praise and pudding?&rsquo;&nbsp; The
world answers, or his biographers answer for him, that he needs
to reinstate himself in his mistress&rsquo;s affection; which is
true or not, according as we take it.&nbsp; If they mean thereby,
as most seem to mean, that it was a mere selfish and ambitious
scheme by which to wriggle into court favour once more&mdash;why,
let them mean it: I shall only observe that the method which
Raleigh took was a rather more dangerous and self-sacrificing one
than courtiers are wont to take.&nbsp; But if it be meant that
Walter Raleigh spoke somewhat thus with himself,&mdash;&lsquo;I
have done a base and dirty deed, and have been punished for
it.&nbsp; I have hurt the good name of a sweet woman who loves
me, and whom I find to be a treasure; and God, instead of
punishing me by taking her from me, has rendered me good for evil
by giving her to me.&nbsp; I have justly offended a mistress whom
I worship, and who, after having shown her just indignation, has
returned me good for evil by giving me these fair lands of
Sherborne, and only forbid me her presence till the scandal has
passed away.&nbsp; She sees and rewards my good in spite of my
evil; and I, too, know that I am better than I have seemed; that
I am fit for nobler deeds than seducing maids of honour.&nbsp;
How can I prove that?&nbsp; How can I redeem my lost name for
patriotism and public daring?&nbsp; How can I win glory for my
wife, seek that men shall forget her past shame in the thought,
&ldquo;She is Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s wife?&rdquo;&nbsp; How can I
show my mistress that I loved her all along, that I acknowledge
her bounty, her mingled justice and mercy?&nbsp; How can I render
to God for all the benefits which He has done unto me?&nbsp; How
can I do a deed the like of which was never done in
England?&rsquo;</p>
<p>If all this had passed through Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s mind,
what could we say of it, but that it was the natural and rational
feeling of an honourable and right-hearted man, burning to rise
to the level which he knew ought to be his, because he knew that
he had fallen below it?&nbsp; And what right better way of
testifying these feelings than to do what, as we shall see,
Raleigh did?&nbsp; What right have we to impute to him lower
motives than these, while we confess that these righteous and
noble motives would have been natural and rational;&mdash;indeed,
just what we flatter ourselves that we should have felt in his
place?&nbsp; Of course, in his grand scheme, the thought came in,
&lsquo;And I shall win to myself honour, and glory, and
wealth,&rsquo;&mdash;of course.&nbsp; And pray, sir, does it not
come in in your grand schemes; and yours; and yours?&nbsp; If you
made a fortune to-morrow by some wisely and benevolently managed
factory, would you forbid all speech of the said wisdom and
benevolence, because you had intended that wisdom and benevolence
should pay you a good percentage?&nbsp; Away with cant, and let
him that is without sin among you cast the first stone.</p>
<p>So Raleigh hits upon a noble project; a desperate one, true:
but he will do it or die.&nbsp; He will leave pleasant Sherborne,
and the bosom of the beautiful bride, and the first-born son, and
all which to most makes life worth having, and which Raleigh
enjoys more intensely than most men; for he is a poet, and a man
of strong nervous passions withal.&nbsp; But,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I could not love thee, dear, so much,<br />
Loved I not honour more.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he will go forth to endure heat, hunger, fever, danger of
death in battle, danger of the Inquisition, rack, and stake, in
search of El Dorado.&nbsp; What so strange in that?&nbsp; I have
known half a dozen men who, in his case, and conscious of his
powers, would have done the same from the same noble motive.</p>
<p>He begins prudently; and sends a Devonshire man, Captain
Whiddon&mdash;probably one of The Whiddons of beautiful
Chagford&mdash;to spy out the Orinoco.&nbsp; He finds that the
Spaniards are there already; that Berreo, who has attempted El
Dorado from the westward, starting from New Granada and going
down the rivers, is trying to settle on the Orinoco mouth; that
he is hanging the poor natives, encouraging the Caribs to hunt
them and sell them for slaves, imprisoning the caciques to extort
their gold, torturing, ravishing, kidnapping, and conducting
himself as was usual among Spaniards of those days.</p>
<p>Raleigh&rsquo;s spirit is stirred within him.&nbsp; If
&lsquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin,&rsquo; fiction as it is, once
excited us, how must a far worse reality have excited Raleigh, as
he remembered that these Spaniards are as yet triumphant in
iniquity, and as he remembered, too, that these same men are the
sworn foes of England, her liberty, her Bible, and her
Queen?&nbsp; What a deed, to be beforehand with them for
once!&nbsp; To dispossess them of one corner of that western
world, where they have left no trace but blood and flame!&nbsp;
He will go himself: he will find El Dorado and its golden
Emperor; and instead of conquering, plundering, and murdering
him, as Cortez did Montezuma, and Pizarro Atahuallpa, he will
show him English strength; espouse his quarrel against the
Spaniards; make him glad to become Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s vassal
tributary, perhaps leave him a bodyguard of English veterans,
perhaps colonise his country, and so at once avenge and protect
the oppressed Indians, and fill the Queen&rsquo;s treasury with
the riches of a land equal, if not superior, to Peru and
Mexico.</p>
<p>Such is his dream; vague perhaps: but far less vague than
those with which Cortez and Pizarro started, and succeeded.&nbsp;
After a careful survey of the whole matter, I must give it as my
deliberate opinion, that Raleigh was more reasonable in his
attempt, and had more fair evidence of its feasibility, than
either Cortez or Pizarro had for theirs.&nbsp; It is a bold
assertion.&nbsp; If any reader doubts its truth, he cannot do
better than to read the whole of the documents connected with the
two successful, and the one unsuccessful, attempts at finding a
golden kingdom.&nbsp; Let them read first Prescott&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Conquests of Mexico and Peru,&rsquo; and then
Schomburgk&rsquo;s edition of Raleigh&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Guiana.&rsquo;&nbsp; They will at least confess, when they
have finished, that truth is stranger than fiction.</p>
<p>Of Raleigh&rsquo;s credulity in believing in El Dorado, much
has been said.&nbsp; I am sorry to find even so wise a man as Sir
Robert Schomburgk, after bearing good testimony to
Raleigh&rsquo;s wonderful accuracy about all matters which he had
an opportunity of observing, using this term of credulity.&nbsp;
I must dare to differ on that point even with Sir Robert, and ask
by what right the word is used?&nbsp; First, Raleigh says nothing
about El Dorado (as every one is forced to confess) but what
Spaniard on Spaniard had been saying for fifty years.&nbsp;
Therefore the blame of credulity ought to rest with the
Spaniards, from Philip von Huten, Orellano, and George of Spires,
upward to Berreo.&nbsp; But it rests really with no one.&nbsp;
For nothing, if we will examine the documents, is told of the
riches of El Dorado which had not been found to be true, and seen
by the eyes of men still living, in Peru and Mexico.&nbsp; Not
one-fifth of America had been explored, and already two El
Dorados had been found and conquered.&nbsp; What more rational
than to suppose that there was a third, a fourth, a fifth, in the
remaining four-fifths?&nbsp; The reports of El Dorado among the
savages were just of the same kind as those by which Cortez and
Pizarro hunted out Mexico and Peru, saving that they were far
more widely spread, and confirmed by a succession of
adventurers.&nbsp; I entreat readers to examine this matter in
Raleigh, Schomburgk, Humboldt, and Condamine, and judge for
themselves.&nbsp; As for Hume&rsquo;s accusations, I pass them by
as equally silly and shameless, only saying, for the benefit of
readers, that they have been refuted completely by every one who
has written since Hume&rsquo;s days; and to those who are
inclined to laugh at Raleigh for believing in Amazons and
&lsquo;men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders&rsquo; I
can only answer thus&mdash;</p>
<p>About the Amazons, Raleigh told what he was told; what the
Spaniards who went before him, and Condamine who came after him,
were told.&nbsp; Humboldt thinks the story possibly founded on
fact; and I must say that, after reviewing all that has been said
thereon, it does seem to me the simplest solution of the matter
just to believe it true; to believe that there was, about his
time, or a little before, somewhere about the Upper Orinoco, a
warlike community of women.&nbsp; Humboldt shows how likely such
would be to spring up where women flee from their male tyrants
into the forests.&nbsp; As for the fable which connected them
with the Lake Manoa and the city of El Dorado, we can only
answer, &lsquo;If not true there and then, it is true elsewhere
now&rsquo;; for the Amazonian guards of the King of Dahomey at
this moment, as all know, surpass in strangeness and in ferocity
all that has been reported of the Orinocquan viragos, and thus
prove once more that truth is stranger than fiction. <a

<p>Beside&mdash;and here I stand stubborn, regardless of gibes
and sneers&mdash;it is not yet proven that there was not, in the
sixteenth century, some rich and civilised kingdom like Peru or
Mexico in the interior of South America.&nbsp; Sir Robert
Schomburgk has disproved the existence of Lake Parima; but it
will take a long time, and more explorers than one, to prove that
there are no ruins of ancient cities, such as Stephens stumbled
on in Yucatan, still buried in the depths of the forest.&nbsp;
Fifty years of ruin would suffice to wrap them in a leafy veil
which would hide them from every one who did not literally run
against them.&nbsp; Tribes would die out, or change place, as the
Atures and other great nations have done in those parts, and
every traditional record of them perish gradually; for it is only
gradually and lately that it has perished: while if it be asked,
What has become of the people themselves? the answer is, that
when any race (like most of the American races in the sixteenth
century) is in a dying state, it hardly needs war to thin it
down, and reduce the remnant to savagery.&nbsp; Greater nations
than El Dorado was even supposed to be have vanished ere now, and
left not a trace behind: and so may they.&nbsp; But enough of
this.&nbsp; I leave the quarrel to that honest and patient warder
of tourneys, Old Time, who will surely do right at last, and go
on to the dogheaded worthies, without necks, and long hair
hanging down behind, who, as a cacique told Raleigh, that
&lsquo;they had of late years slain many hundreds of his
father&rsquo;s people,&rsquo; and in whom even Humboldt was not
always allowed, he says, to disbelieve (so much for Hume&rsquo;s
scoff at Raleigh as a liar), one old cacique boasting to him that
he had seen them with his own eyes.&nbsp; Humboldt&rsquo;s
explanation is, that the Caribs, being the cleverest and
strongest Indians, are also the most imaginative; and therefore,
being fallen children of Adam, the greatest liars; and that they
invented both El Dorado and the dog-heads out of pure
wickedness.&nbsp; Be it so.&nbsp; But all lies crystallise round
some nucleus of truth; and it really seems to me nothing very
wonderful if the story should be on the whole true, and these
worthies were in the habit of dressing themselves up, like
foolish savages as they were, in the skins of the Aguara dog,
with what not of stuffing, and tails, and so forth, in order to
astonish the weak minds of the Caribs, just as the Red Indians
dress up in their feasts as bears, wolves, and deer, with
foxtails, false bustles of bison skin, and so forth.&nbsp; There
are plenty of traces of such foolish attempts at playing
&lsquo;bogy&rsquo; in the history of savages, even of our own
Teutonic forefathers; and this I suspect to be the simple
explanation of the whole mare&rsquo;s nest.&nbsp; As for Raleigh
being a fool for believing it; the reasons he gives for believing
it are very rational; the reasons Hume gives for calling him a
fool rest merely on the story&rsquo;s being strange: on which
grounds one might disbelieve most matters in heaven and earth,
from one&rsquo;s own existence to what one sees in every drop of
water under the microscope, yea, to the growth of every
seed.&nbsp; The only sound proof that dog-headed men are
impossible is to be found in comparative anatomy, a science of
which Hume knew no more than Raleigh, and which for one marvel it
has destroyed has revealed a hundred.&nbsp; I do not doubt that
if Raleigh had seen and described a kangaroo, especially its all
but miraculous process of gestation, Hume would have called that
a lie also; but I will waste no more time in proving that no man
is so credulous as the unbeliever&mdash;the man who has such
mighty and world-embracing faith in himself that he makes his own
little brain the measure of the universe.&nbsp; Let the dead bury
their dead.</p>
<p>Raleigh sails for Guiana.&nbsp; The details of his voyage
should be read at length.&nbsp; Everywhere they show the eye of a
poet as well as of a man of science.&nbsp; He sees enough to
excite his hopes more wildly than ever; he goes hundreds of miles
up the Orinoco in an open boat, suffering every misery, but
keeping up the hearts of his men, who cry out, &lsquo;Let us go
on, we care not how far.&rsquo;&nbsp; He makes friendship with
the caciques, and enters into alliance with them on behalf of
Queen Elizabeth against the Spaniards.&nbsp; Unable to pass the
falls of the Caroli, and the rainy season drawing on, he returns,
beloved and honoured by all the Indians, boasting that, during
the whole time he was there, no woman was the worse for any man
of his crew.&nbsp; Altogether, we know few episodes of history so
noble, righteous, and merciful as this Guiana voyage.&nbsp; But
he has not forgotten the Spaniards.&nbsp; At Trinidad he payed
his ships with the asphalt of the famous Pitch-lake, and
stood&mdash;and with what awe such a man must have
stood&mdash;beneath the noble forest of Moriche fan-palms on its
brink.&nbsp; He then attacked, not, by his own confession,
without something too like treachery, the new town of San
Jos&eacute;, takes Berreo prisoner, and delivers from captivity
five caciques, whom Berreo kept bound in one chain,
&lsquo;basting their bodies with burning bacon&rsquo;&mdash;an
old trick of the Conquistadores&mdash;to make them discover their
gold.&nbsp; He tells them that he was &lsquo;the servant of a
Queen who was the greatest cacique of the north, and a virgin;
who had more caciqui under her than there were trees on that
island; that she was an enemy of the Castellani (Spaniards) in
behalf of their tyranny and oppression, and that she delivered
all such nations about her as were by them oppressed, and having
freed all the coast of the northern world from their servitude,
had sent me to free them also, and withal to defend the country
of Guiana from their invasion and conquest.&rsquo;&nbsp; After
which perfectly true and rational speech, he subjoins (as we
think equally honestly and rationally), &lsquo;I showed them her
Majesty&rsquo;s picture, which they so admired and honoured, as
it had been easy to have brought them idolaters
thereof.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is one of the stock charges against Raleigh, at which all
biographers (except quiet, sensible Oldys, who, dull as he is, is
far more fair and rational than most of his successors) break
into virtuous shrieks of &lsquo;flattery,&rsquo;
&lsquo;meanness,&rsquo; &lsquo;adulation,&rsquo;
&lsquo;courtiership,&rsquo; and so forth.&nbsp; One biographer is
of opinion that the Indians would have admired far more the
picture of a &lsquo;red monkey.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sir Robert
Schomburgk, unfortunately for the red monkey theory, though he
quite agrees that Raleigh&rsquo;s flattery was very shocking,
says that from what he knows&mdash;and no man knows more&mdash;of
Indian taste, they would have far preferred to the portrait which
Raleigh showed them&mdash;not a red monkey, but&mdash;such a
picture as that at Hampton Court, in which Elizabeth is
represented in a fantastic court dress.&nbsp; Raleigh, it seems,
must be made out a rogue at all risks, though by the most
opposite charges.&nbsp; The monkey theory is answered, however,
by Sir Robert; and Sir Robert is answered, I think, by the plain
fact that, of course, Raleigh&rsquo;s portrait was exactly such a
one as Sir Robert says they would have admired; a picture
probably in a tawdry frame, representing Queen Bess, just as
queens were always painted then, bedizened with &lsquo;browches,
pearls, and owches,&rsquo; satin and ruff, and probably with
crown on head and sceptre in hand, made up, as likely as not,
expressly for the purpose for which it was used.&nbsp; In the
name of all simplicity and honesty, I ask, why is Raleigh to be
accused of saying that the Indians admired Queen
Elizabeth&rsquo;s beauty when he never even hints at it?&nbsp;
And why do all commentators deliberately forget the preceding
paragraph&mdash;Raleigh&rsquo;s proclamation to the Indians, and
the circumstances under which it was spoken?&nbsp; The Indians
are being murdered, ravished, sold for slaves, basted with
burning fat; and grand white men come like avenging angels, and
in one day sweep their tyrants out of the land, restore them to
liberty and life, and say to them, &lsquo;A great Queen far
across the seas has sent us to do this.&nbsp; Thousands of miles
away she has heard of your misery and taken pity on you; and if
you will be faithful to her she will love you, and deal justly
with you, and protect you against these Spaniards who are
devouring you as they have devoured all the Indians round you;
and for a token of it&mdash;a sign that we tell you truth, and
that there is really such a great Queen, who is the
Indian&rsquo;s friend&mdash;here is the picture of
her.&rsquo;&nbsp; What wonder if the poor idolatrous creatures
had fallen down and worshipped the picture&mdash;just as millions
do that of the Virgin Mary without a thousandth part as sound and
practical reason&mdash;as that of a divine, all-knowing,
all-merciful deliverer?&nbsp; As for its being the picture of a
beautiful woman or not, they would never think of that.&nbsp; The
fair complexion and golden hair would be a sign to them that she
belonged to the mighty white people, even if there were no
bedizenment of jewels and crowns over and above; and that would
be enough for them.&nbsp; When will biographers learn to do
common justice to their fellow-men by exerting now and then some
small amount of dramatic imagination, just sufficient to put
themselves for a moment in the place of those of whom they
write?</p>
<p>So ends his voyage, in which, he says, &lsquo;from myself I
have deserved no thanks, for I am returned a beggar and
withered.&rsquo;&nbsp; The only thing which, as far as I can
find, he brought home was some of the delicious scaly peaches of
the Moriche palm&mdash;the <i>Arbol de Vida</i>, or tree of life,
which gives sustenance and all else needful to whole tribes of
Indians.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I might have bettered my poor estate if
I had not only respected her Majesty&rsquo;s future honour and
riches.&nbsp; It became not the former fortune in which I once
lived to go journeys of piccory&rsquo; (pillage); &lsquo;and it
had sorted ill with the offices of honour which, by her
Majesty&rsquo;s grace, I hold this day in England, to run from
cape to cape and place to place for the pillage of ordinary
prizes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So speaks one whom it has been the fashion to consider as
little better than a pirate, and that, too, in days when the
noblest blood in England thought no shame (as indeed it was no
shame) to enrich themselves with Spanish gold.&nbsp; But so it is
throughout this man&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; If there be a nobler word
than usual to be spoken, or a more wise word either, if there be
a more chivalrous deed to be done, or a more prudent deed either,
that word and that deed are pretty sure to be Walter
Raleigh&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But the blatant beast has been busy at home; and, in spite of
Chapman&rsquo;s heroical verses, he meets with little but cold
looks.&nbsp; Never mind.&nbsp; If the world will not help to do
the deed, he will do it by himself; and no time must be lost, for
the Spaniards on their part will lose none.&nbsp; So, after six
months, the faithful Keymis sails again, again helped by the Lord
High Admiral and Sir Robert Cecil.&nbsp; It is a hard race for
one private man against the whole power and wealth of Spain; and
the Spaniard has been beforehand with them, and re-occupied the
country.&nbsp; They have fortified themselves at the mouth of the
Caroli, so it is impossible to get to the gold mines; they are
enslaving the wretched Indians, carrying off their women,
intending to transplant some tribes and to expel others, and
arming cannibal tribes against the inhabitants.&nbsp; All is
misery and rapine; the scattered remnant comes asking piteously
why Raleigh does not come over to deliver them?&nbsp; Have the
Spaniards slain him, too?&nbsp; Keymis comforts them as he best
can; hears of more gold mines; and gets back safe, a little to
his own astonishment; for eight-and-twenty ships of war have been
sent to Trinidad to guard the entrance to El Dorado, not surely,
as Keymis well says, &lsquo;to keep us only from
tobacco.&rsquo;&nbsp; A colony of 500 persons is expected from
Spain.&nbsp; The Spaniard is well aware of the richness of the
prize, says Keymis, who all through shows himself a worthy pupil
of his master.&nbsp; A careful, observant man he seems to have
been, trained by that great example to overlook no fact, even the
smallest.&nbsp; He brings home lists of rivers, towns, caciques,
poison-herbs, words, what not; he has fresh news of gold,
spleen-stones, kidney-stones, and some fresh specimens; but be
that as it may, he, &lsquo;without going as far as his eyes can
warrant, can promise Brazil-wood, honey, cotton, balsamum, and
drugs, to defray charges.&rsquo;&nbsp; He would fain copy
Raleigh&rsquo;s style, too, and &lsquo;whence his lamp had oil,
borrow light also,&rsquo; &lsquo;seasoning his unsavoury
speech&rsquo; with some of the &lsquo;leaven of Raleigh&rsquo;s
discourse.&rsquo;&nbsp; Which, indeed, he does even to little
pedantries and attempts at classicality; and after professing
that himself and the remnant of his few years he hath bequeathed
wholly to Raleana, and his thoughts live only in that action, he
rises into something like grandeur when he begins to speak of
that ever-fertile subject, the Spanish cruelties to the Indians;
&lsquo;Doth not the cry of the poor succourless ascend unto the
heavens?&nbsp; Hath God forgotten to be gracious to the work of
his own hands.&nbsp; Or shall not his judgments in a day of
visitation by the ministry of his chosen servant come upon these
bloodthirsty butchers, like rain into a fleece of
wool?&rsquo;&nbsp; Poor Keymis!&nbsp; To us he is by no means the
least beautiful figure in this romance; a faithful, diligent,
loving man, unable, as the event proved, to do great deeds by
himself, but inspired with a great idea by contact with a
mightier spirit, to whom he clings through evil report, and
poverty, and prison, careless of self to the last, and ends
tragically, &lsquo;faithful unto death&rsquo; in the most awful
sense.</p>
<p>But here remark two things: first, that Cecil believes in
Raleigh&rsquo;s Guiana scheme; next, that the occupation of
Orinoco by the Spaniards, which Raleigh is accused of having
concealed from James in 1617, has been ever since 1595 matter of
the most public notoriety.</p>
<p>Raleigh has not been idle in the meanwhile.&nbsp; It has been
found necessary after all to take the counsel which he gave in
vain in 1588, to burn the Spanish fleet in harbour; and the
heroes are gone down to Cadiz fight, and in one day of thunder
storm the Sevastopol of Spain.&nbsp; Here, as usual, we find
Raleigh, though in an inferior command, leading the whole by
virtue of superior wisdom.&nbsp; When the good Lord Admiral will
needs be cautious, and land the soldiers first, it is Raleigh who
persuades him to force his way into the harbour, to the joy of
all captains.&nbsp; When hotheaded Essex, casting his hat into
the sea for joy, shouts &lsquo;<i>Intramos</i>,&rsquo; and will
in at once, Raleigh&rsquo;s time for caution comes, and he
persuades them to wait till the next morning, and arrange the
order of attack.&nbsp; That, too, Raleigh has to do, and moreover
to lead it; and lead it he does.&nbsp; Under the forts are
seventeen galleys; the channel is &lsquo;scoured&rsquo; with
cannon: but on holds Raleigh&rsquo;s &lsquo;Warspite,&rsquo; far
ahead of the rest, through the thickest of the fire, answering
forts and galleys &lsquo;with a blur of the trumpet to each
piece, disdaining to shoot at those esteemed dreadful
monsters.&rsquo;&nbsp; For there is a nobler enemy ahead.&nbsp;
Right in front lie the galleons; and among them the
&lsquo;Philip&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Andrew,&rsquo; two of those
who boarded the &lsquo;Revenge.&rsquo;&nbsp; This day there shall
be a reckoning for the blood of his old friend; he is
&lsquo;resolved to be revenged for the
&ldquo;Revenge,&rdquo;&rsquo; Sir Richard Grenvile&rsquo;s fatal
ship, or second her with his own life&rsquo;; and well he keeps
his vow.&nbsp; Three hours pass of desperate valour, during
which, so narrow is the passage, only seven English ships,
thrusting past each other, all but quarrelling in their noble
rivalry, engage the whole Spanish fleet of fifty-seven sail, and
destroy it utterly.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Philip&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Thomas&rsquo; burn themselves despairing.&nbsp; The
English boats save the &lsquo;Andrew&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Matthew.&rsquo;&nbsp; One passes over the hideous
record.&nbsp; &lsquo;If any man,&rsquo; says Raleigh, &lsquo;had
a desire to see hell itself, it was there most lively
figured.&rsquo;&nbsp; Keymis&rsquo;s prayer is answered in part,
even while he writes it; and the cry of the Indians has not
ascended in vain before the throne of God!</p>
<p>The soldiers are landed; the city stormed and sacked, not
without mercies and courtesies, though, to women and unarmed
folk, which win the hearts of the vanquished, and live till this
day in well-known ballads.&nbsp; The Flemings begin a
&lsquo;merciless slaughter.&rsquo;&nbsp; Raleigh and the Lord
Admiral beat them off.&nbsp; Raleigh is carried on shore with a
splinter wound in the leg, which lames him for life: but returns
on board in an hour in agony; for there is no admiral left to
order the fleet, and all are run headlong to the sack.&nbsp; In
vain he attempts to get together sailors the following morning,
and attack the Indian fleet in Porto Real Roads; within
twenty-four hours it is burnt by the Spaniards themselves; and
all Raleigh wins is no booty, a lame leg, and the honour of
having been the real author of a victory even more glorious than
that of 1588.</p>
<p>So he returns; having written to Cecil the highest praises of
Essex, whom he treats with all courtesy and fairness; which those
who will may call cunning: we have as good a right to say that he
was returning good for evil.&nbsp; There were noble qualities in
Essex.&nbsp; All the world gave him credit for them, and far more
than he deserved; why should not Raleigh have been just to him;
even have conceived, like the rest of the world, high hopes of
him, till he himself destroyed these hopes?&nbsp; For now storms
are rising fast.&nbsp; On their return Cecil is in power.&nbsp;
He has been made Secretary of State instead of Bodley,
Essex&rsquo;s pet, and the spoilt child begins to sulk.&nbsp; On
which matter, I am sorry to say, historians talk much unwisdom,
about Essex&rsquo;s being too &lsquo;open and generous, etc., for
a courtier,&rsquo; and &lsquo;presuming on his mistress&rsquo;s
passion for him&rsquo;; and representing Elizabeth as desiring to
be thought beautiful, and &lsquo;affecting at sixty the sighs,
loves, tears, and tastes of a girl of sixteen,&rsquo; and so
forth.&nbsp; It is really time to get rid of some of this fulsome
talk, culled from such triflers as Osborne, if not from the
darker and fouler sources of Parsons and the Jesuit slanderers,
which I meet with a flat denial.&nbsp; There is simply no
proof.&nbsp; She in love with Essex or Cecil?&nbsp; Yes, as a
mother with a son.&nbsp; Were they not the children of her
dearest and most faithful servants, men who had lived heroic
lives for her sake?&nbsp; What wonder if she fancied that she saw
the fathers in the sons?&nbsp; They had been trained under her
eye.&nbsp; What wonder if she fancied that they could work as
their fathers worked before them?&nbsp; And what shame if her
childless heart yearned over them with unspeakable affection, and
longed in her old age to lay her hands upon the shoulders of
those two young men, and say to England, &lsquo;Behold the
children which God, and not the flesh, has given me!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Most strange it is, too, that women, who ought at least to know a
woman&rsquo;s heart, have been especially forward in publishing
these scandals, and sullying their pages by retailing pruriences
against such a one as Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p>But to return.&nbsp; Raleigh attaches himself to Cecil; and he
has good reason.&nbsp; Cecil is the cleverest man in England,
saving himself.&nbsp; He has trusted and helped him, too, in two
Guiana voyages; so the connection is one of gratitude as well as
prudence.&nbsp; We know not whether he helped him in the third
Guiana voyage in the same year, under Captain Berry, a north
Devon man, from Grenvile&rsquo;s country; who found a
&lsquo;mighty folk,&rsquo; who were &lsquo;something pleasant,
having drunk much that day,&rsquo; and carried bows with golden
handles: but failed in finding the Lake Parima, and so came
home.</p>
<p>Raleigh&rsquo;s first use of his friendship with Cecil is to
reconcile him, to the astonishment of the world, with Essex,
alleging how much good may grow by it; for now &lsquo;the
Queen&rsquo;s continual unquietness will grow to
contentment.&rsquo;&nbsp; That, too, those who will may call
policy.&nbsp; We have as good a right to call it the act of a
wise and faithful subject, and to say, &lsquo;Blessed are the
peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of
God.&rsquo;&nbsp; He has his reward for it in full restoration to
the Queen&rsquo;s favour; he deserves it.&nbsp; He proves himself
once more worthy of power, and it is given to him.&nbsp; Then
there is to be a second great expedition: but this time its aim
is the Azores.&nbsp; Philip, only maddened by the loss at Cadiz,
is preparing a third armament for the invasion of England and
Ireland, and it is said to lie at the islands to protect the
Indian fleet.&nbsp; Raleigh has the victualling of the
land-forces, and, like everything else he takes in hand,
&lsquo;it is very well done.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lord Howard declines
the chief command, and it is given to Essex.&nbsp; Raleigh is to
be rear-admiral.</p>
<p>By the time they reach the Azores, Essex has got up a foolish
quarrel against Raleigh for disrespect in having stayed behind to
bring up some stragglers.&nbsp; But when no Armada is to be found
at the Azores, Essex has after all to ask Raleigh what he shall
do next.&nbsp; Conquer the Azores, says Raleigh, and the thing is
agreed on.&nbsp; Raleigh and Essex are to attack Fayal.&nbsp;
Essex sails away before Raleigh has watered.&nbsp; Raleigh
follows as fast as he can, and at Fayal finds no Essex.&nbsp; He
must water there, then and at once.&nbsp; His own veterans want
him to attack forthwith, for the Spaniards are fortifying fast:
but he will wait for Essex.&nbsp; Still no Essex comes.&nbsp;
Raleigh attempts to water, is defied, finds himself &lsquo;in for
it,&rsquo; and takes the island out of hand in the most masterly
fashion, to the infuriation of Essex.&nbsp; Good Lord Howard
patches up the matter, and the hot-headed coxcomb is once more
pacified.&nbsp; They go on to Graciosa, where Essex&rsquo;s
weakness of will again comes out, and he does not take the
island.&nbsp; Three rich Caracks, however, are picked up.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Though we shall be little the better for them,&rsquo; says
Raleigh privately to Sir Arthur Gorges, his faithful captain,
&lsquo;yet I am heartily glad for our General&rsquo;s sake;
because they will in great measure give content to her Majesty,
so that there may be no repining against this poor Lord for the
expense of the voyage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Raleigh begins to see that Essex is only to be pitied; that
the voyage is not over likely to end well: but he takes it, in
spite of ill-usage, as a kind-hearted man should.&nbsp; Again
Essex makes a fool of himself.&nbsp; They are to steer one way in
order to intercept the Plate-fleet.&nbsp; Essex having agreed to
the course pointed out, alters his course on a fancy; then alters
it a second time, though the hapless Monson, with the whole
Plate-fleet in sight, is hanging out lights, firing guns, and
shrieking vainly for the General, who is gone on a new course, in
which he might have caught the fleet after all, in spite of his
two mistakes, but that he chooses to go a roundabout way instead
of a short one; and away goes the whole fleet, save one Carack,
which runs itself on shore and burns, and the game is played out
and lost.</p>
<p>All want Essex to go home, as the season is getting late: but
the wilful and weak man will linger still, and while he is
hovering to the south, Philip&rsquo;s armament has sailed from
the Groyne, on the undefended shores of England, and only
God&rsquo;s hand saves us from the effects of Essex&rsquo;s
folly.&nbsp; A third time the Armadas of Spain are overwhelmed by
the avenging tempests, and Essex returns to disgrace, having
proved himself at once intemperate and incapable.&nbsp; Even in
coming home there is confusion, and Essex is all but lost on the
Bishop and Clerks, by Scilly, in spite of the warnings of
Raleigh&rsquo;s sailing-master, &lsquo;Old Broadbent,&rsquo; who
is so exasperated at the general stupidity that he wants Raleigh
to leave Essex and his squadron to get out of their own scrape as
they can.</p>
<p>Essex goes off to sulk at Wanstead; but Vere excuses him, and
in a few days he comes back, and will needs fight good Lord
Howard for being made Earl of Nottingham for his services against
the Armada and at Cadiz.&nbsp; Baulked of this, he begins laying
the blame of the failure at the Azores on Raleigh.&nbsp; Let the
spoilt naughty boy take care; even that &lsquo;admirable
temper&rsquo; for which Raleigh is famed may be worn out at
last.</p>
<p>These years are Raleigh&rsquo;s noon&mdash;stormy enough at
best, yet brilliant.&nbsp; There is a pomp about him, outward and
inward, which is terrible to others, dangerous to himself.&nbsp;
One has gorgeous glimpses of that grand Durham House of his, with
its carvings and its antique marbles, armorial escutcheons,
&lsquo;beds with green silk hangings and legs like dolphins,
overlaid with gold&rsquo;: and the man himself, tall, beautiful,
and graceful, perfect alike in body and in mind, walking to and
fro, his beautiful wife upon his arm, his noble boy beside his
knee, in his &lsquo;white satin doublet, embroidered with pearls,
and a great chain of pearls about his neck,&rsquo; lording it
among the lords with an &lsquo;awfulness and ascendency above
other mortals,&rsquo; for which men say that &lsquo;his
n&aelig;ve is, that he is damnable proud&rsquo;; and no
wonder.&nbsp; The reduced squire&rsquo;s younger son has gone
forth to conquer the world; and he fancies, poor fool, that he
has conquered it, just as it really has conquered him; and he
will stand now on his blood and his pedigree (no bad one either),
and all the more stiffly because puppies like Lord Oxford, who
instead of making their fortunes have squandered them, call him
&lsquo;jack and upstart,&rsquo; and make impertinent faces while
the Queen is playing the virginals, about &lsquo;how when jacks
go up, heads go down.&rsquo;&nbsp; Proud?&nbsp; No wonder if the
man be proud!&nbsp; &lsquo;Is not this great Babylon, which I
have built?&rsquo;&nbsp; And yet all the while he has the most
affecting consciousness that all this is not God&rsquo;s will,
but the will of the flesh; that the house of fame is not the
house of God; that its floor is not the rock of ages, but the sea
of glass mingled with fire, which may crack beneath him any
moment, and let the nether flame burst up.&nbsp; He knows that he
is living in a splendid lie; that he is not what God meant him to
be.&nbsp; He longs to flee away and be at peace.&nbsp; It is to
this period, not to his death-hour, that &lsquo;The Lie&rsquo;
belongs; <a name="citation155"></a><a href="#footnote155"
class="citation">[155]</a> saddest of poems, with its melodious
contempt and life-weariness.&nbsp; All is a lie&mdash;court,
church, statesmen, courtiers, wit and science, town and country,
all are shams; the days are evil; the canker is at the root of
all things; the old heroes are dying one by one; the Elizabethan
age is rotting down, as all human things do, and nothing is left
but to bewail with Spenser &lsquo;The Ruins of Time&rsquo;; the
glory and virtue which have been&mdash;the greater glory and
virtue which might be even now, if men would but arise and
repent, and work righteousness, as their fathers did before
them.&nbsp; But no.&nbsp; Even to such a world as this he will
cling, and flaunt it about as captain of the guard in the
Queen&rsquo;s progresses and masques and pageants, with
sword-belt studded with diamonds and rubies, or at tournaments,
in armour of solid silver, and a gallant train with orange-tawny
feathers, provoking Essex to bring in a far larger train in the
same colours, and swallow up Raleigh&rsquo;s pomp in his own, so
achieving that famous &lsquo;feather triumph&rsquo; by which he
gains little but bad blood and a good jest.&nbsp; For Essex is no
better tilter than he is general; and having &lsquo;run very
ill&rsquo; in his orange-tawny, comes next day in green, and runs
still worse, and yet is seen to be the same cavalier; whereon a
spectator shrewdly observes that he changed his colours
&lsquo;that it may be reported that there was one in green who
ran worse than he in orange-tawny.&rsquo;&nbsp; But enough of
these toys, while God&rsquo;s handwriting is upon the wall above
all heads.</p>
<p>Raleigh knows that the handwriting is there.&nbsp; The spirit
which drove him forth to Virginia and Guiana is fallen asleep:
but he longs for Sherborne and quiet country life, and escapes
thither during Essex&rsquo;s imprisonment, taking Cecil&rsquo;s
son with him, and writes as only he can write about the
shepherd&rsquo;s peaceful joys, contrasted with
&lsquo;courts&rsquo; and &lsquo;masques&rsquo; and &lsquo;proud
towers&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Here are no false
entrapping baits<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Too hasty for too hasty fates,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless it be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fond credulity<br />
Of silly fish, that worlding who still look<br />
Upon the bait, but never on the hook;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor envy, unless among<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The birds, for prize of their sweet song.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Go! let the diving negro seek<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For pearls hid in some forlorn creek,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all pearls scorn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Save what the dewy morn<br />
Congeals upon some little spire of grass,<br />
Which careless shepherds beat down as they pass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And gold ne&rsquo;er here
appears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Save what the yellow Ceres bears.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tragic enough are the after scenes of Raleigh&rsquo;s life:
but most tragic of all are these scenes of vain-glory, in which
he sees the better part, and yet chooses the worse, and pours out
his self-discontent in song which proves the fount of delicacy
and beauty which lies pure and bright beneath the gaudy
artificial crust.&nbsp; What might not this man have been!&nbsp;
And he knows that too.&nbsp; The stately rooms of Durham House
pall on him, and he delights to hide up in his little study among
his books and his chemical experiments, and smoke his silver
pipe, and look out on the clear Thames and the green Surrey
hills, and dream about Guiana and the Tropics; or to sit in the
society of antiquaries with Selden and Cotton, Camden and Stow;
or in his own Mermaid Club, with Ben Jonson, Fletcher, Beaumont,
and at last with Shakspeare&rsquo;s self to hear and utter</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Words that have been<br
/>
So nimble, and so full of subtle flame,<br />
As if that every one from whom they came<br />
Had meant to put his whole wit in a jest.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anything to forget the handwriting on the wall, which will not
be forgotten.&nbsp; But he will do all the good which he can
meanwhile, nevertheless.&nbsp; He will serve God and
Mammon.&nbsp; So complete a man will surely be able to do
both.&nbsp; Unfortunately the thing is impossible, as he
discovers too late: but he certainly goes as near success in the
attempt as ever man did.&nbsp; Everywhere we find him doing
justly and loving mercy.&nbsp; Wherever this man steps he leaves
his footprint ineffaceably in deeds of benevolence.&nbsp; For one
year only, it seems, he is governor of Jersey; yet to this day,
it is said, the islanders honour his name, only second to that of
Duke Rollo, as their great benefactor, the founder of their
Newfoundland trade.&nbsp; In the west country he is &lsquo;as a
king,&rsquo; &lsquo;with ears and mouth always open to hear and
deliver their grievances, feet and hands ready to go and work
their redress.&rsquo;&nbsp; The tin-merchants have become usurers
&lsquo;of fifty in the hundred.&rsquo;&nbsp; Raleigh works till
he has put down their &lsquo;abominable and cut-throat
dealing.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is a burdensome west-country tax on
curing fish; Raleigh works till it is revoked.&nbsp; In
Parliament he is busy with liberal measures, always before his
generation.&nbsp; He puts down a foolish act for compulsory
sowing of hemp in a speech on the freedom of labour worthy of the
nineteenth century.&nbsp; He argues against raising the subsidy
from the three-pound men&mdash;&lsquo;Call you this, Mr. Francis
Bacon, <i>par jugum</i>, when a poor man pays as much as a
rich?&rsquo;&nbsp; He is equally rational and spirited against
the exportation of ordnance to the enemy; and when the question
of abolishing monopolies is mooted he has his wise word.&nbsp; He
too is a monopolist of tin, as Lord Warden of the
Stannaries.&nbsp; But he has so wrought as to bring good out of
evil; for &lsquo;before the granting of his patent, let the price
of tin be never so high, the poor workman never had but two
shillings a week&rsquo;; yet now, so has he extended and
organised the tin-works, &lsquo;that any man who will can find
work, be tin at what price soever, and have four shillings a week
truly paid . . . Yet if all others may be repealed, I will give
my consent as freely to the cancelling of this as any member of
this house.&rsquo;&nbsp; Most of the monopolies were repealed:
but we do not find that Raleigh&rsquo;s was among them.&nbsp; Why
should it be if its issue was more tin, full work, and double
wages?&nbsp; In all things this man approves himself faithful in
his generation.&nbsp; His sins are not against man, but against
God; such as the world thinks no sins, and hates them, not from
morality, but from envy.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the evil which, so Spenser had prophesied,
only waited Raleigh&rsquo;s death breaks out in his absence, and
Ireland is all aflame with Tyrone&rsquo;s rebellion.&nbsp;
Raleigh is sent for.&nbsp; He will not accept the post of Lord
Deputy and go to put it down.&nbsp; Perhaps he does not expect
fair play as long as Essex is at home.&nbsp; Perhaps he knows too
much of the &lsquo;common weal, or rather common woe,&rsquo; and
thinks that what is crooked cannot be made straight.&nbsp;
Perhaps he is afraid to lose by absence his ground at
court.&nbsp; Would that he had gone, for Ireland&rsquo;s sake and
his own.&nbsp; However, it must not be.&nbsp; Ormond is recalled,
and Knollys shall be sent: but Essex will have none but Sir
George Carew; whom, Naunton says, he hates, and wishes to oust
from court.&nbsp; He and Elizabeth argue it out.&nbsp; He turns
his back on her, and she gives him&mdash;or does not give him,
for one has found so many of these racy anecdotes vanish on
inspection into simple wind, that one believes none of
them&mdash;a box on the ear; which if she did, she did the most
wise, just, and practical thing which she could do with such a
puppy.&nbsp; He claps his hand&mdash;or does not&mdash;to his
sword, &lsquo;He would not have taken it from Henry VIII.,&rsquo;
and is turned out forthwith.&nbsp; In vain Egerton, the Lord
Keeper, tries to bring him to reason.&nbsp; He storms
insanely.&nbsp; Every one on earth is wrong but he: every one is
conspiring against him; he talks of &lsquo;Solomon&rsquo;s
fool&rsquo; too.&nbsp; Had he read the Proverbs a little more
closely, he might have left the said fool alone, as being a too
painfully exact likeness of himself.&nbsp; It ends by his being
worsted, and Raleigh rising higher than ever.&nbsp; I cannot see
why Raleigh should be represented as henceforth becoming
Essex&rsquo;s &lsquo;avowed enemy,&rsquo; save on the ground that
all good men are and ought to be the enemies of bad men, when
they see them about to do harm, and to ruin the country.&nbsp;
Essex is one of the many persons upon whom this age has lavished
a quantity of sentimentality, which suits oddly enough with its
professions of impartiality.&nbsp; But there is an impartiality
which ends in utter injustice; which by saying carelessly to
every quarrel, &lsquo;Both are right, and both are wrong,&rsquo;
leaves only the impression that all men are wrong, and ends by
being unjust to every one.&nbsp; So has Elizabeth and
Essex&rsquo;s quarrel been treated.&nbsp; There was some evil in
Essex; therefore Elizabeth was a fool for liking him.&nbsp; There
was some good in Essex; therefore Elizabeth was cruel in
punishing him.&nbsp; This is the sort of slipshod dilemma by
which Elizabeth is proved to be wrong, even while Essex is
confessed to be wrong too; while the patent facts of the case
are, that Elizabeth bore with him as long as she could, and a
great deal longer than any one else could.&nbsp; Why Raleigh
should be accused of helping to send Essex into Ireland, I do not
know.&nbsp; Camden confesses (at the same time that he gives a
hint of the kind) that Essex would let no one go but
himself.&nbsp; And if this was his humour, one can hardly wonder
at Cecil and Raleigh, as well as Elizabeth, bidding the man
begone and try his hand at government, and be filled with the
fruit of his own devices.&nbsp; He goes; does nothing; or rather
worse than nothing; for in addition to the notorious
ill-management of the whole matter, we may fairly say that he
killed Elizabeth.&nbsp; She never held up her head again after
Tyrone&rsquo;s rebellion.&nbsp; Elizabeth still clings to him,
changing her mind about him every hour, and at last writes him
such a letter as he deserves.&nbsp; He has had power, money, men,
such as no one ever had before.&nbsp; Why has he done nothing but
bring England to shame?&nbsp; He comes home frantically&mdash;the
story of his bursting into the dressing-room rests on no good
authority&mdash;with a party of friends at his heels, leaving
Ireland to take care of itself.&nbsp; Whatever entertainment he
met with from the fond old woman, he met with the coldness which
he deserved from Raleigh and Cecil.&nbsp; Who can wonder?&nbsp;
What had he done to deserve aught else?&nbsp; But he all but
conquers; and Raleigh takes to his bed in consequence, sick of
the whole matter; as one would have been inclined to do
oneself.&nbsp; He is examined and arraigned; writes a maudlin
letter to Elizabeth.&nbsp; Elizabeth has been called a fool for
listening to such pathetical &lsquo;love letters&rsquo;: and then
hardhearted for not listening to them.&nbsp; Poor Lady! do what
she would, she found it hard enough to please all parties while
alive; must she be condemned over and above <i>in
&aelig;ternum</i> to be wrong whatsoever she did?&nbsp; Why is
she not to have the benefit of the plain straightforward
interpretation which would be allowed to any other human being;
namely, that she approved of such fine talk as long as it was
proved to be sincere by fine deeds: but that when these were
wanting, the fine talk became hollow, fulsome, a fresh cause of
anger and disgust?&nbsp; Yet still she weeps over Essex when he
falls sick, as any mother would; and would visit him if she could
with honour.&nbsp; But a &lsquo;malignant influence counteracts
every disposition to relent.&rsquo;&nbsp; No doubt, a man&rsquo;s
own folly, passion, and insolence has generally a very malignant
influence on his fortunes; and he may consider himself a very
happy man if all that befalls to him thereby is what befell
Essex, namely, deprivation of his offices and imprisonment in his
own house.&nbsp; He is forgiven after all; but the spoilt child
refuses his bread and butter without sugar.&nbsp; What is the
pardon to him without a renewal of his licence of sweet
wines?&nbsp; Because he is not to have that, the Queen&rsquo;s
&lsquo;conditions are as crooked as her carcase.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Flesh and blood can stand no more, and ought to stand no
more.&nbsp; After all that Elizabeth has been to him, that speech
is the speech of a brutal and ungrateful nature.&nbsp; And such
he shows himself to be in the hour of trial.&nbsp; What if the
patent for sweet wines is refused him?&nbsp; Such gifts were
meant as the reward of merit; and what merit has he to
show?&nbsp; He never thinks of that.&nbsp; Blind with fury, he
begins to intrigue with James, and slanders to him, under colour
of helping his succession, all whom he fancies opposed to
him.&nbsp; What is worse, he intrigues with Tyrone about bringing
over an army of Irish Papists to help him against the Queen, and
this at the very time that his sole claim to popularity rests on
his being the leader of the Puritans.&nbsp; A man must have been
very far gone, either in baseness or in hatred, who represents
Raleigh to James as dangerous to the commonweal on account of his
great power in the west of England and Jersey, &lsquo;places fit
for the Spaniard to land in.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cobham, as Warden of
the Cinque Ports, is included in his slander; and both he and
Raleigh will hear of it again.</p>
<p>Some make much of a letter, supposed to be written about this
time by Raleigh to Cecil, bidding Cecil keep down Essex, even
crush him, now that he is once down.&nbsp; I do not happen to
think the letter to be Raleigh&rsquo;s.&nbsp; His initials are
subscribed to it; but not his name and the style is not like
his.&nbsp; But as for seeing &lsquo;unforgiveness and revenge in
it,&rsquo; whose soever it may be, I hold and say there is not a
word which can bear such a construction.&nbsp; It is a dark
letter: but about a dark matter and a dark man.&nbsp; It is a
worldly and expediential letter, appealing to low motives in
Cecil, though for a right end; such a letter, in short, as
statesmen are wont to write nowadays.&nbsp; If Raleigh wrote it,
God punished him for doing so speedily enough.&nbsp; He does not
usually punish statesmen nowadays for such letters; perhaps
because He does not love them as well as Raleigh.&nbsp; But as
for the letter itself.&nbsp; Essex is called a
&lsquo;tyrant,&rsquo; because he had shown himself one.&nbsp; The
Queen is to &lsquo;hold Bothwell,&rsquo; because &lsquo;while she
hath him, he will even be the canker of her estate and
safety,&rsquo; and the writer has &lsquo;seen the last of her
good days and of ours after his liberty.&rsquo;&nbsp; On which
accounts, Cecil is not to be deterred from doing what is right
and necessary &lsquo;by any fear of after-revenges&rsquo; and
&lsquo;conjectures from causes remote,&rsquo; as many a stronger
instance&mdash;given&mdash;will prove, but &lsquo;look to the
present,&rsquo; and so &lsquo;do wisely.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is no
real cause for Cecil&rsquo;s fear.&nbsp; If the man who has now
lost a power which he ought never to have had be now kept down,
then neither he nor his son will ever be able to harm the man who
has kept him at his just level.&nbsp; What &lsquo;revenge,
selfishness, and craft&rsquo; there can be in all this it is
difficult to see; as difficult as to see why Essex is to be
talked of as &lsquo;unfortunate,&rsquo; and the blame of his
frightful end thrown on every one but himself: the fact being
that Essex&rsquo;s end was brought on by his having chosen one
Sunday morning for breaking out into open rebellion, for the
purpose of seizing the city of London and the Queen&rsquo;s
person, and compelling her to make him lord and master of the
British Isles; in which attempt he and his fought with the civil
and military authorities, till artillery had to be brought up and
many lives were lost.&nbsp; Such little escapades may be
pardonable enough in &lsquo;noble and unfortunate&rsquo; earls:
but readers will perhaps agree that if they chose to try a
similar experiment, they could not complain if they found
themselves shortly after in company with Mr. Mitchell at Spike
Island or Mr. Oxford in Bedlam.&nbsp; However, those were days in
which such Sabbath amusements on the part of one of the most
important and powerful personages of the realm could not be
passed over so lightly, especially when accompanied by severe
loss of life; and as there existed in England certain statutes
concerning rebellion and high treason, which must needs have been
framed for some purpose or other, the authorities of England may
be excused for fancying that they bore some reference to such
acts as that which the noble and unfortunate earl had just
committed, as wantonly, selfishly, and needlessly, it seems to
me, as ever did man on earth.</p>
<p>I may seem to jest too much upon so solemn a matter as the
life of a human being: but if I am not to touch the popular talk
about Essex in this tone, I can only touch it in a far sterner
one; and if ridicule is forbidden, express disgust instead.</p>
<p>I have entered into this matter of Essex somewhat at length,
because on it is founded one of the mean slanders from which
Raleigh never completely recovered.&nbsp; The very mob who, after
Raleigh&rsquo;s death, made him a Protestant martyr&mdash;as,
indeed, he was&mdash;looked upon Essex in the same light, hated
Raleigh as the cause of his death, and accused him of glutting
his eyes with Essex&rsquo;s misery, puffing tobacco out of a
window, and what not&mdash;all mere inventions, so Raleigh
declared upon the scaffold.&nbsp; He was there in his office as
captain of the guard, and could do no less than be there.&nbsp;
Essex, it is said, asked for Raleigh just before he died: but
Raleigh had withdrawn, the mob having murmured.&nbsp; What had
Essex to say to him?&nbsp; Was it, asks Oldys, shrewdly enough,
to ask him pardon for the wicked slanders which he had been
pouring into James&rsquo;s credulous and cowardly ears?&nbsp; We
will hope so; and leave poor Essex to God and the mercy of God,
asserting once more that no man ever brought ruin and death more
thoroughly on himself by his own act, needing no imaginary help
downwards from Raleigh, Cecil, or other human being.</p>
<p>And now begins the fourth act of this strange tragedy.&nbsp;
Queen Elizabeth dies; and dies of grief.&nbsp; It has been the
fashion to attribute to her, I know not why, remorse for
Essex&rsquo;s death; and the foolish and false tale about Lady
Nottingham and the ring has been accepted as history.&nbsp; The
fact seems to be that she never really held up her head after
Burleigh&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; She could not speak of him without
tears; forbade his name to be mentioned in the Council.&nbsp; No
wonder; never had mistress a better servant.&nbsp; For nearly
half a century have these two noble souls loved each other,
trusted each other, worked with each other; and God&rsquo;s
blessing has been on their deeds; and now the faithful
God-fearing man is gone to his reward; and she is growing old,
and knows that the ancient fire is dying out in her; and who will
be to her what he was?&nbsp; Buckhurst is a good man, and one of
her old pupils; and she makes him Lord Treasurer in
Burleigh&rsquo;s place: but beyond that all is dark.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am a miserable forlorn woman; there is none about me
that I can trust.&rsquo;&nbsp; She sees through Cecil; through
Henry Howard.&nbsp; Essex has proved himself worthless, and pays
the penalty of his sins.&nbsp; Men are growing worse than their
fathers.&nbsp; Spanish gold is bringing in luxury and sin.&nbsp;
The last ten years of her reign are years of decadence,
profligacy, falsehood; and she cannot but see it.&nbsp;
Tyrone&rsquo;s rebellion is the last drop which fills the
cup.&nbsp; After fifty years of war, after a drain of money all
but fabulous expended on keeping Ireland quiet, the volcano
bursts forth again just as it seemed extinguished, more fiercely
than ever, and the whole work has to be done over again, when
there is neither time nor a man to do it.&nbsp; And ahead, what
hope is there for England?&nbsp; Who will be her successor?&nbsp;
She knows in her heart that it will be James: but she cannot
bring herself to name him.&nbsp; To bequeath the fruit of all her
labours to a tyrant, a liar, and a coward: for she knows the man
but too well.&nbsp; It is too hideous to be faced.&nbsp; This is
the end then?&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh that I were a milke maide, with a
paile upon mine arm!&rsquo;&nbsp; But it cannot be.&nbsp; It
never could have been; and she must endure to the end.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Therefore I hated life; yea, I hated all my labour
which I had taken under the sun; because I should leave it to the
man that shall be after me.&nbsp; And who knows whether he shall
be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my
labour wherein I have showed myself wise, in wisdom, and
knowledge, and equity . . . Vanity of vanities, and vexation of
spirit!&rsquo;&nbsp; And so, with a whole book of Ecclesiastes
written on that mighty heart, the old lioness coils herself up in
her lair, refuses food, and dies.&nbsp; I know few passages in
the world&rsquo;s history more tragic than that death.</p>
<p>Why did she not trust Raleigh?&nbsp; First, because Raleigh,
as we have seen, was not the sort of man whom she needed.&nbsp;
He was not the steadfast single-eyed statesman; but the
many-sided genius.&nbsp; Besides, he was the ringleader of the
war-party.&nbsp; And she, like Burleigh before his death, was
tired of the war; saw that it was demoralising England; was
anxious for peace.&nbsp; Raleigh would not see that.&nbsp; It was
to him a divine mission which must be fulfilled at all
risks.&nbsp; As long as the Spaniards were opposing the Indians,
conquering America, there must be no peace.&nbsp; Both were right
from their own point of view.&nbsp; God ordered the matter from a
third point of view.</p>
<p>Besides, we know that Essex, and after him Cecil and Henry
Howard, had been slandering Raleigh basely to James.&nbsp; Can we
doubt that the same poison had been poured into Elizabeth&rsquo;s
ears?&nbsp; She might distrust Cecil too much to act upon what he
said of Raleigh; and yet distrust Raleigh too much to put the
kingdom into his hands.&nbsp; However, she is gone now, and a new
king has arisen, who knoweth not Joseph.</p>
<p>James comes down to take possession.&nbsp; Insolence, luxury,
and lawlessness mark his first steps on his going amid the
adulations of a fallen people; he hangs a poor wretch without
trial; wastes his time in hunting by the way;&mdash;a bad and
base man, whose only redeeming point&mdash;if in his case it be
one&mdash;is his fondness for little children.&nbsp; But that
will not make a king.&nbsp; The wiser elders take counsel
together.&nbsp; Raleigh and good Judge Fortescue are for
requiring conditions from the newcomer; and constitutional
liberty makes its last stand among the men of Devon, the old
county of warriors, discoverers, and statesmen, of which Queen
Bess had said that the men of Devon were her right hand.&nbsp;
But in vain; James has his way; Cecil and Henry Howard are
willing enough to give it him.</p>
<p>So down comes Rehoboam, taking counsel with the young men, and
makes answer to England, &lsquo;My father chastised you with
whips; but I will chastise you with scorpions.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
takes a base pleasure, shocking to the French ambassador, in
sneering at the memory of Queen Elizabeth; a perverse delight in
honouring every rascal whom she had punished.&nbsp; Tyrone must
come to England to be received into favour, maddening the soul of
honest Sir John Harrington.&nbsp; Essex is christened &lsquo;my
martyr,&rsquo; apparently for having plotted treason against
Elizabeth with Tyrone.&nbsp; Raleigh is received with a
pun&mdash;&lsquo;By my soul, I have heard rawly of thee,
mon&rsquo;; and when the great nobles and gentlemen come to court
with their retinues, James tries to hide his dread of them in an
insult; pooh-poohs their splendour, and says, &lsquo;he doubts
not that he should have been able to win England for himself, had
they kept him out.&rsquo;&nbsp; Raleigh answers boldly,
&lsquo;Would God that had been put to the trial.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Because then you would have known
your friends from your foes.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;A reason,&rsquo;
says old Aubrey, &lsquo;never forgotten or forgiven.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Aubrey is no great authority; but the speech smacks so of
Raleigh&rsquo;s offhand daring that one cannot but believe it; as
one does also the other story of his having advised the lords to
keep out James and erect a republic.&nbsp; Not that he could have
been silly enough to propose such a thing seriously at that
moment; but that he most likely, in his bold way, may have said,
&lsquo;Well, if we are to have this man in without conditions,
better a republic at once.&rsquo;&nbsp; Which, if he did say, he
said what the next forty years proved to be strictly true.&nbsp;
However, he will go on his own way as best he can.&nbsp; If James
will give him a loan, he and the rest of the old heroes will
join, fit out a fleet against Spain, and crush her, now that she
is tottering and impoverished, once and for ever.&nbsp; But James
has no stomach for fighting; cannot abide the sight of a drawn
sword; would not provoke Spain for the world&mdash;why, they
might send Jesuits and assassinate him; and as for the money, he
wants that for very different purposes.&nbsp; So the answer which
he makes to Raleigh&rsquo;s proposal of war against Spain is to
send him to the Tower, and sentence him to be hanged, drawn, and
quartered, on a charge of plotting with Spain.</p>
<p>Having read, I believe, nearly all that has been written on
the subject of this dark &lsquo;Cobham plot,&rsquo; I find but
one thing come brightly out of the infinite confusion and
mystery, which will never be cleared up till the day of judgment,
and that is Raleigh&rsquo;s innocence.&nbsp; He, and all England,
and the very men who condemned him, knew that he was
innocent.&nbsp; Every biographer is forced to confess this, more
or less, in spite of all efforts to be what is called
&lsquo;impartial.&rsquo;&nbsp; So I shall waste no words upon the
matter, only observing that whereas Raleigh is said to have
slandered Cecil to James, in the same way that Cecil had
slandered him, one passage of this Cobham plot disproves utterly
such a story, which, after all, rests (as far as I know) only on
hearsay, being &lsquo;spoken of in a manuscript written by one
Buck, secretary to Chancellor Egerton.&rsquo;&nbsp; For in
writing to his own wife, in the expectation of immediate death,
Raleigh speaks of Cecil in a very different tone, as one in whom
he trusted most, and who has left him in the hour of need.&nbsp;
I ask the reader to peruse that letter, and say whether any man
would write thus, with death and judgment before his face, of one
whom he knew that he had betrayed; or, indeed, of one who he knew
had betrayed him.&nbsp; I see no reason to doubt that Raleigh
kept good faith with Cecil, and that he was ignorant till after
his trial that Cecil was in the plot against him.</p>
<p>I do not care to enter into the tracasseries of this Cobham
plot.&nbsp; Every one knows them; no one can unravel them.&nbsp;
The moral and spiritual significance of the fact is more
interesting than all questions as to Cobham&rsquo;s lies,
Brooke&rsquo;s lies, Aremberg&rsquo;s lies, Coke&rsquo;s lies,
James&rsquo;s lies:&mdash;Let the dead bury their dead.&nbsp; It
is the broad aspect of the thing which is so wonderful; to see
how</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The eagle, towering in his pride of
place,<br />
Was by a mousing owl hawked at and killed.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the man who six months ago, perhaps, thought that he
and Cecil were to rule England together, while all else were the
puppets whose wires they pulled.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Lord hath taken
him up and dashed him down;&rsquo; and by such means, too, and on
such a charge!&nbsp; Betraying his country to Spain!&nbsp;
Absurd&mdash;incredible&mdash;he would laugh it to scorn: but it
is bitter earnest.&nbsp; There is no escape.&nbsp; True or false,
he sees that his enemies will have his head.&nbsp; It is
maddening: a horrible nightmare.&nbsp; He cannot bear it; he
cannot face&mdash;so he writes to that beloved
wife&mdash;&lsquo;the scorn, the taunts, the loss of honour, the
cruel words of lawyers.&rsquo;&nbsp; He stabs himself.&nbsp; Read
that letter of his, written after the mad blow had been struck;
it is sublime from intensity of agony.&nbsp; The way in which the
chastisement was taken proves how utterly it was needed, ere that
proud, success-swollen, world-entangled heart could be brought
right with God.</p>
<p>And it is brought right.&nbsp; The wound is not mortal.&nbsp;
He comes slowly to a better mind, and takes his doom like a
man.&nbsp; That first farewell to his wife was written out of
hell.&nbsp; The second rather out of heaven.&nbsp; Read it, too,
and compare; and then see how the Lord has been working upon this
great soul: infinite sadness, infinite tenderness and patience,
and trust in God for himself and his poor wife: &lsquo;God is my
witness, it was for you and yours that I desired life; but it is
true that I disdain myself for begging it.&nbsp; For know, dear
wife, that your son is the son of a true man, and one who, in his
own respect, despiseth death and all his ugly and misshapen forms
. . . The everlasting, powerful, infinite, and omnipotent God,
who is goodness itself, the true life and light, keep thee and
thine, have mercy upon me, and teach me to forgive my persecutors
and accusers, and send us to meet in His glorious
kingdom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Is it come to this then?&nbsp; Is he fit to die at last?&nbsp;
Then he is fit to live; and live he shall.&nbsp; The tyrants have
not the heart to carry out their own crime, and Raleigh shall be
respited.</p>
<p>But not pardoned.&nbsp; No more return for him into that
sinful world, where he flaunted on the edge of the precipice, and
dropped heedless over it.&nbsp; God will hide him in the secret
place of His presence, and keep him in His tabernacle from the
strife of tongues; and a new life shall begin for him; a wiser,
perhaps a happier, than he has known since he was a little lad in
the farmhouse in pleasant Devon far away.&nbsp; On the 15th of
December he enters the Tower.&nbsp; Little dreams he that for
more than twelve years those doleful walls would be his
home.&nbsp; Lady Raleigh obtains leave to share his prison with
him, and, after having passed ten years without a child, brings
him a boy to comfort the weary heart.&nbsp; The child of sorrow
is christened Carew.&nbsp; Little think those around him what
strange things that child will see before his hairs be
gray.&nbsp; She has her maid, and he his three servants; some
five or six friends are allowed &lsquo;to repair to him at
convenient times.&rsquo;&nbsp; He has a chamber-door always open
into the lieutenant&rsquo;s garden, where he &lsquo;has converted
a little hen-house into a still-room, and spends his time all the
day in distillation.&rsquo;&nbsp; The next spring a grant is made
of his goods and chattels, forfeited by attainder, to trustees
named by himself, for the benefit of his family.&nbsp; So far, so
well; or, at least, not as ill as it might be: but there are
those who cannot leave the caged lion in peace.</p>
<p>Sanderson, who had married his niece, instead of paying up the
arrears which he owes on the wine and other offices, brings in a
claim of &pound;2000.&nbsp; But the rogue meets his match, and
finds himself, at the end of a lawsuit, in prison for debt.&nbsp;
Greater rogues, however, will have better fortune, and break
through the law-cobwebs which have stopped a poor little fly like
Sanderson.&nbsp; For Carr, afterwards Lord Somerset, casts his
eyes on the Sherborne land.&nbsp; It has been included in the
conveyance, and should be safe; but there are others who, by
instigation surely of the devil himself, have had eyes to see a
flaw in the deed.&nbsp; Sir John Popham is appealed to.&nbsp; Who
could doubt the result?&nbsp; He answers that there is no doubt
that the words were omitted by the inattention of the
engrosser&mdash;Carew Raleigh says that but one single word was
wanting, which word was found notwithstanding in the paper-book,
<i>i.e.</i> the draft&mdash;but that the word not being there,
the deed is worthless, and the devil may have his way.&nbsp; To
Carr, who has nothing of his own, it seems reasonable enough to
help himself to what belongs to others, and James gives him the
land.&nbsp; Raleigh writes to him, gently, gracefully,
loftily.&nbsp; Here is an extract: &lsquo;And for yourself, sir,
seeing your fair day is now in the dawn, and mine drawn to the
evening, your own virtues and the king&rsquo;s grace assuring you
of many favours and much honour, I beseech you not to begin your
first building upon the ruins of the innocent; and that their
sorrows, with mine, may not attend your first
plantation.&rsquo;&nbsp; He speaks strongly of the fairness,
sympathy, and pity by which the Scots in general had laid him
under obligation: argues from it his own evident innocence; and
ends with a quiet warning to the young favourite not to
&lsquo;undergo the curse of them that enter into the fields of
the fatherless.&rsquo;&nbsp; In vain.&nbsp; Lady Raleigh, with
her children, entreats James on her knees: in vain again.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I mun ha&rsquo; the land,&rsquo; is the answer; &lsquo;I
mun ha&rsquo; it for Carr.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he has it; patching
up the matter after a while by a gift of &pound;8000 to her and
her elder son, in requital for an estate of &pound;5000 a
year.</p>
<p>So there sits Raleigh, growing poorer day by day, and clinging
more and more to that fair wife, and her noble boy, and the babe
whose laughter makes music within that dreary cage.&nbsp; And all
day long, as we have seen, he sits over his still, compounding
and discovering, and sometimes showing himself on the wall to the
people, who gather to gaze at him, till Wade forbids it, fearing
popular feeling.&nbsp; In fact, the world outside has a sort of
mysterious awe of him, as if he were a chained magician, who, if
he were let loose, might do with them all what he would.&nbsp;
Certain great nobles are of the same mind.&nbsp; Woe to them if
that silver tongue should once again be unlocked!</p>
<p>The Queen, with a woman&rsquo;s faith in greatness, sends to
him for &lsquo;cordials.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here is one of them, famous
in Charles the Second&rsquo;s days as &lsquo;Sir Walter&rsquo;s
Cordial&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>

<p>Which, so the world believes, will cure all ills which flesh
is heir to.&nbsp; It does not seem that Raleigh so boasted
himself; but the people, after the fashion of the time, seem to
have called all his medicines &lsquo;cordials,&rsquo; and
probably took for granted that it was by this particular one that
the enchanter cured Queen Anne of a desperate sickness,
&lsquo;whereof the physicians were at the farthest end of their
studies&rsquo; (no great way to go in those days) &lsquo;to find
the cause, and at a nonplus for the cure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Raleigh&mdash;this is Sir Anthony Welden&rsquo;s account,
which may go for what it is worth&mdash;asks for his reward, only
justice.&nbsp; Will the Queen ask that certain lords may be sent
to examine Cobham, &lsquo;whether he had at any time accused Sir
Walter of any treason under his hand?&rsquo;&nbsp; Six are
sent.&nbsp; Cobham answers, &lsquo;Never; nor could I: that
villain Wade often solicited me, and not so prevailing, got me by
a trick to write my name on a piece of white paper.&nbsp; So that
if a charge come under my hand it was forged by that villain
Wade, by writing something above my hand, without my consent or
knowledge.&rsquo;&nbsp; They return.&nbsp; An equivocation was
ready.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sir, my Lord Cobham has made good all that
ever he wrote or said&rsquo;; having, by his own account, written
nothing but his name.&nbsp; This is Sir Anthony Welden&rsquo;s
story.&nbsp; One hopes, for the six lords&rsquo; sake, it may not
be true; but there is no reason, in the morality of James&rsquo;s
court, why it should not have been.</p>
<p>So Raleigh must remain where he is, and work on.&nbsp; And he
does work.&nbsp; As his captivity becomes more and more hopeless,
so comes out more and more the stateliness, self-help, and energy
of the man.&nbsp; Till now he has played with his pen: now he
will use it in earnest; and use it as few prisoners have
done.&nbsp; Many a good book has been written in a
dungeon&mdash;&lsquo;Don Quixote,&rsquo; the
&lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rsquo;: beautiful each in its
way, and destined to immortality: Raleigh begins the
&lsquo;History of the World,&rsquo; the most God-fearing and
God-seeing history which I know of among English writings; though
blotted by flattery of James in the preface: wrong: but
pardonable in a man trying in the Tower to get out of that
doleful prison.&nbsp; But all his writings are thirty years too
late; they express the creed of a buried generation, of the men
who defied Spain in the name of a God of righteousness,&mdash;not
of men who cringe before her in the name of a God of power and
cunning.&nbsp; The captive eagle has written with a quill from
his own wing&mdash;a quill which has been wont ere now to soar to
heaven.&nbsp; Every line smacks of the memories of Nombre and of
Zutphen, of Tilbury Fort and of Calais Roads; and many a
gray-headed veteran, as he read them, must have turned away his
face to hide the noble tears, as Ulysses from Demodocus when he
sang the song of Troy.&nbsp; So there sits Raleigh, like the
prophet of old, in his lonely tower above the Thames, watching
the darkness gather upon the land year by year, &lsquo;like the
morning spread over the mountains,&rsquo; the darkness which
comes before the dawn of the Day of The Lord; which he shall
never see on earth, though it be very near at hand; and asks of
each newcomer, &lsquo;Watchman, what of the night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But there is one bright point at least in the darkness; one on
whom Raleigh&rsquo;s eyes, and those of all England, are fixed in
boundless hope; one who, by the sympathy which attracts all noble
natures to each other, clings to the hero utterly; Henry, the
Crown Prince.&nbsp; &lsquo;No king but my father would keep such
a bird in a cage.&rsquo;&nbsp; The noble lad tries to open the
door for the captive eagle; but in vain.&nbsp; At least he will
make what use he can of his wisdom.&nbsp; He asks him for advice
about the new ship he is building, and has a simple practical
letter in return, and over and above probably the two valuable
pamphlets, &lsquo;Of the Invention of Ships,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Observations on the Navy and Sea Service&rsquo;; which the
Prince will never see.&nbsp; In 1611 he asks Raleigh&rsquo;s
advice about the foolish double marriage with the Prince and
Princess of Savoy, and receives for answer two plain-spoken
discourses as full of historical learning as of practical sound
sense.</p>
<p>These are benefits which must be repaid.&nbsp; The father will
repay them hereafter in his own way.&nbsp; In the meanwhile the
son does so in his way, by soliciting the Sherborne estate as for
himself, intending to restore it to Raleigh.&nbsp; He
succeeds.&nbsp; Carr is bought off for &pound;25,000, where Lady
Raleigh has been bought off with &pound;8000; but neither Raleigh
nor his widow will ever be the better for that bargain, and Carr
will get Sherborne back again, and probably, in the King&rsquo;s
silly dotage, keep the &pound;25,000 also.</p>
<p>In November 1612 Prince Henry falls sick.</p>
<p>When he is at the last gasp, the poor Queen sends to Raleigh
for some of the same cordial which had cured her.&nbsp; Medicine
is sent, with a tender letter, as it well might be; for Raleigh
knew how much hung, not only for himself, but for England, on the
cracking threads of that fair young life.&nbsp; It is questioned
at first whether it shall be administered.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
cordial,&rsquo; Raleigh says, &lsquo;will cure him or any other
of a fever, except in case of poison.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The cordial is administered; but it comes too late.&nbsp; The
prince dies, and with him the hopes of all good men.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>At last, after twelve years of prison, Raleigh is free.&nbsp;
He is sixty-six years old now, gray-headed and worn down by
confinement, study, and want of exercise: but he will not
remember that.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Still in his ashes live their wonted
fire.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now for Guiana, at last! which he has never forgotten; to
which he has been sending, with his slender means, ship after
ship to keep the Indians in hope.</p>
<p>He is freed in March.&nbsp; At once he is busy in his
project.&nbsp; In August he has obtained the King&rsquo;s
commission, by the help of Sir Ralph Winwood, Secretary of State,
who seems to have believed in Raleigh.&nbsp; At least Raleigh
believed in him.&nbsp; In March next year he has sailed, and with
him thirteen ships, and more than a hundred knights and
gentlemen, and among them, strange to say, Sir Warham St.
Leger.&nbsp; This is certainly not the quondam Marshal of Munster
under whom Raleigh served at Smerwick six-and-thirty years
ago.&nbsp; He would be nearly eighty years old; and as Lord
Doneraile&rsquo;s pedigree gives three Sir Warhams, we cannot
identify the man.&nbsp; But it is a strong argument in
Raleigh&rsquo;s favour that a St. Leger, of a Devon family which
had served with him in Ireland, and intimately connected with him
his whole life, should keep his faith in Raleigh after all his
reverses.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the mere fact of an unpardoned
criminal, said to be <i>non ens</i> in law, being able in a few
months to gather round him such a party, is proof patent of what
slender grounds there are for calling Raleigh
&lsquo;suspected&rsquo; and &lsquo;unpopular.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But he does not sail without a struggle or two.&nbsp; James is
too proud to allow his heir to match with any but a mighty king,
is infatuated about the Spanish marriage; and Gondomar is with
him, playing with his hopes and with his fears also.</p>
<p>The people are furious, and have to be silenced again and
again: there is even fear of rioting.&nbsp; The charming and
smooth-tongued Gondomar can hate, and can revenge, too.&nbsp;
Five &rsquo;prentices who have insulted him for striking a little
child, are imprisoned and fined several hundred pounds
each.&nbsp; And as for hating Raleigh, Gondomar had been no
Spaniard (to let alone the private reasons which some have
supposed) had he not hated Spain&rsquo;s ancient scourge and
unswerving enemy.&nbsp; He comes to James, complaining that
Raleigh is about to break the peace with Spain.&nbsp; Nothing is
to be refused him which can further the one darling fancy of
James; and Raleigh has to give in writing the number of his
ships, men, and ordnance, and, moreover, the name of the country
and the very river whither he is going.&nbsp; This paper was
given, Carew Raleigh asserts positively, under James&rsquo;s
solemn promise not to reveal it; and Raleigh himself seems to
have believed that it was to be kept private; for he writes
afterwards to Secretary Winwood in a tone of astonishment and
indignation, that the information contained in his paper had been
sent on to the King of Spain before he sailed from the
Thames.&nbsp; Winwood could have told him as much already; for
Buckingham had written to Winwood, on March 28, to ask him why he
had not been to the Spanish Ambassador &lsquo;to acquaint him
with the order taken by his Majesty about Sir W. R.&rsquo;s
voyage.&rsquo;&nbsp; But however unwilling the Secretary (as one
of the furtherers of the voyage) may have been to meddle in the
matter, Gondomar had had news enough from another source; perhaps
from James&rsquo;s own mouth.&nbsp; For the first letter to the
West Indies about Raleigh was dated from Madrid, March 19; and
most remarkable it is that in James&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Declaration,&rsquo; or rather apology for his own conduct,
no mention whatsoever is made of his having given information to
Gondomar.</p>
<p>Gondomar offered, says James, to let Raleigh go with one or
two ships only.&nbsp; He might work a mine, and the King of Spain
would give him a safe convoy home with all his gold.&nbsp; How
kind.&nbsp; And how likely would Raleigh and his
fellow-adventurers have been to accept such an offer; how likely,
too, to find men who would sail with them on such an errand, to
be &lsquo;flayed alive,&rsquo; as many who travelled to the
Indies of late years had been, or to have their throats cut, tied
back to back, after trading unarmed and peaceably for a month, as
thirty-six of Raleigh&rsquo;s men had been but two or three years
before in that very Orinoco.&nbsp; So James is forced to let the
large fleet go; and to let it go well armed also; for the plain
reason, that otherwise it dare not go at all; and in the
meanwhile letters are sent from Spain, in which the Spaniards
call the fleet &lsquo;English enemies,&rsquo; and ships and
troops are moved up as fast as possible from the Spanish
main.</p>
<p>But, say some, James was justified in telling Gondomar, and
the Spaniards in defending themselves.&nbsp; On the latter point
there is no doubt.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;They may get who have the will,<br />
And they may keep who can.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it does seem hard on Raleigh, after having laboured in
this Guiana business for years, and after having spent his money
in vain attempts to deliver these Guianians from their
oppressors.&nbsp; It is hard, and he feels it so.&nbsp; He sees
that he is not trusted; that, as James himself confesses, his
pardon is refused simply to keep a hold on him; that, if he
fails, he is ruined.</p>
<p>As he well asks afterwards, &lsquo;If the King did not think
that Guiana was his, why let me go thither at all?&nbsp; He knows
that it was his by the law of nations, for he made Mr. Harcourt a
grant of part of it.&nbsp; If it be, as Gondomar says, the King
of Spain&rsquo;s, then I had no more right to work a mine in it
than to burn a town.&rsquo;&nbsp; An argument which seems to me
unanswerable.&nbsp; But, says James, and others with him, he was
forbid to meddle with any country occupate or possessed by
Spaniards.&nbsp; Southey, too, blames him severely for not having
told James that the country was already settled by
Spaniards.&nbsp; I can excuse Southey, but not James, for
overlooking the broad fact that all England knew it, as I have
shown, since 1594; that if they did not, Gondomar would have
taken care to tell them; and that he could not go to Guiana
without meddling with Spaniards.&nbsp; His former voyages and
publications made no secret of it.&nbsp; On the contrary, one
chief argument for the plan had been all through the delivery of
the Indians from these very Spaniards, who, though they could not
conquer them, ill-used them in every way: and in his agreement
with the Lords about the Guiana voyage in 1611, he makes especial
mention of the very place which will soon fill such a part in our
story, &lsquo;San Thom&eacute;, where the Spaniards
inhabit,&rsquo; and tells the Lords whom to ask as to the number
of men who will be wanted &lsquo;to secure Keymish&rsquo;s
passage to the mine&rsquo; against these very Spaniards.&nbsp;
What can be more clear, save to those who will not see?</p>
<p>The plain fact is that Raleigh went, with his eyes open, to
take possession of a country to which he believed that he and
King James had a right, and that James and his favourites, when
they, as he pleads, might have stopped him by a word, let him go,
knowing as well as the Spaniards what he intended; for what
purpose, but to have an excuse for the tragedy which ended all,
it is difficult to conceive.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is evident,&rsquo;
wisely says Sir Robert Schomburgk, &lsquo;that they winked at
consequences which they must have foreseen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And here Mr. Napier, on the authority of Count Desmarets,
brings a grave charge against Raleigh.&nbsp; Raleigh in his
&lsquo;Apology&rsquo; protests that he only saw Desmarets once on
board of his vessel.&nbsp; Desmarets says in his despatches that
he was on board of her several times&mdash;whether he saw Raleigh
more than once does not appear&mdash;and that Raleigh complained
to him of having been unjustly imprisoned, stripped of his
estate, and so forth; and that he was on that account resolved to
abandon his country, and, if the expedition succeeded, offer
himself and the fruit of his labour to the King of France.</p>
<p>If this be true, Raleigh was very wrong.&nbsp; But Sir Robert
Schomburgk points out that this passage, which Mr. Napier says
occurs in the last despatch, was written a month after Raleigh
had sailed; and that the previous despatch, written only four
days after Raleigh sailed, says nothing about the matter.&nbsp;
So that it could not have been a very important or fixed
resolution on Raleigh&rsquo;s part, if it was only to be
recollected a month after.&nbsp; I do not say&mdash;as Sir Robert
Schomburgk is very much inclined to do&mdash;that it was
altogether a bubble of French fancy.&nbsp; It is possible that
Raleigh, in his just rage at finding that James was betraying him
and sending him out with a halter round his neck, to all but
certain ruin, did say wild words&mdash;That it was better for him
to serve the Frenchman than such a master&mdash;that perhaps he
might go over to the Frenchman after all&mdash;or some folly of
the kind, in that same rash tone which, as we have seen, has got
him into trouble so often already: and so I leave the matter,
saying, Beware of making any man an offender for a word, much
less one who is being hunted to death in his old age, and knows
it.</p>
<p>However this may be, the fleet sails; but with no bright
auguries.&nbsp; The mass of the sailors are &lsquo;a scum of
men&rsquo;; they are mutinous and troublesome; and what is worse,
have got among them (as, perhaps, they were intended to have) the
notion that Raleigh&rsquo;s being still <i>non ens</i> in law
absolves them from obeying him when they do not choose, and
permits them to say of him behind his back what they list.&nbsp;
They have long delays at Plymouth.&nbsp; Sir Warham&rsquo;s ship
cannot get out of the Thames.&nbsp; Pennington, at the Isle of
Wight, &lsquo;cannot redeem his bread from the bakers,&rsquo; and
has to ride back to London to get money from Lady Raleigh.&nbsp;
The poor lady has it not, and gives a note of hand to Mr. Wood of
Portsmouth.&nbsp; Alas for her!&nbsp; She has sunk her
&pound;8000, and, beside that, sold her Wickham estate for
&pound;2500; and all is on board the fleet.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
hundred pieces&rsquo; are all the ready money the hapless pair
had left on earth, and they have parted them together.&nbsp;
Raleigh has fifty-five and she forty-five till God send it
back&mdash;if, indeed, He ever send it.&nbsp; The star is sinking
low in the west.&nbsp; Trouble on trouble.&nbsp; Sir John Fane
has neither men nor money; Captain Witney has not provisions
enough, and Raleigh has to sell his plate in Plymouth to help
him.&nbsp; Courage! one last struggle to redeem his good
name.</p>
<p>Then storms off Sicily&mdash;a pinnace is sunk; faithful
Captain King drives back into Bristol; the rest have to lie by a
while in some Irish port for a fair wind.&nbsp; Then Bailey
deserts with the &lsquo;Southampton&rsquo; at the Canaries; then
&lsquo;unnatural weather,&rsquo; so that a fourteen days&rsquo;
voyage takes forty days.&nbsp; Then &lsquo;the distemper&rsquo;
breaks out under the line.&nbsp; The simple diary of that sad
voyage still remains, full of curious and valuable nautical
hints; but recording the loss of friend on friend; four or five
officers, and, &lsquo;to our great grief, our principal refiner,
Mr. Fowler.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Crab, my old
servant.&rsquo;&nbsp; Next a lamentable twenty-four hours, in
which they lose Pigott, the lieutenant-general, &lsquo;mine
honest frinde, Mr. John Talbot, one that had lived with me a
leven yeeres in the Tower, an excellent general skoller, and a
faithful and true man as ever lived,&rsquo; with two &lsquo;very
fair conditioned gentleman,&rsquo; and &lsquo;mine own cook
Francis.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then more officers and men, and my
&lsquo;cusen Payton.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then the water is near spent,
and they are forced to come to half allowance, till they save and
drink greedily whole canfuls of the bitter rain water.&nbsp; At
last Raleigh&rsquo;s own turn comes; running on deck in a squall,
he gets wet through, and has twenty days of burning fever;
&lsquo;never man suffered a more furious heat,&rsquo; during
which he eats nothing but now and then a stewed prune.</p>
<p>At last they make the land at the mouth of the Urapoho, far
south of their intended goal.&nbsp; They ask for Leonard the
Indian, &lsquo;who lived with me in England three or four years,
the same man that took Mr. Harcourt&rsquo;s brother and fifty men
when they were in extreme distress, and had no means to live
there but by the help of this Indian, whom they made believe that
they were my men&rsquo;; but the faithful Indian is gone up the
country, and they stand away for Cayenne, &lsquo;where the
cacique (Harry) was also my servant, and had lived with me in the
Tower two years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Courage once more, brave old heart!&nbsp; Here at least thou
art among friends, who know thee for what thou art, and look out
longingly for thee as their deliverer.&nbsp; Courage; for thou
art in fairyland once more; the land of boundless hope and
possibility.&nbsp; Though England and England&rsquo;s heart be
changed, yet God&rsquo;s earth endures, and the harvest is still
here, waiting to be reaped by those who dare.&nbsp; Twenty stormy
years may have changed thee, but they have not changed the
fairyland of thy prison dreams.&nbsp; Still the mighty Ceiba
trees with their wealth of parasites and creepers tower above the
palm-fringed islets; still the dark mangrove thickets guard the
mouths of unknown streams, whose granite sands are rich with
gold.&nbsp; Friendly Indians come, and Harry with them, bringing
maize, peccari pork, and armadillos, plantains and pine-apples,
and all eat and gather strength; and Raleigh writes home to his
wife, &lsquo;to say that I may yet be King of the Indians here
were a vanity.&nbsp; But my name hath lived among
them&rsquo;&mdash;as well it might.&nbsp; For many a year those
simple hearts shall look for him in vain, and more than two
centuries and a half afterwards, dim traditions of the great
white chief who bade them stand out to the last against the
Spaniards, and he would come and dwell among them, shall linger
among the Carib tribes; even, say some, the tattered relics of an
English flag, which he left among them that they might
distinguish his countrymen.</p>
<p>Happy for him had he stayed there indeed, and been their
king.&nbsp; How easy for him to have grown old in peace at
Cayenne.&nbsp; But no; he must on for honour&rsquo;s sake, and
bring home if it were but a basketful of that ore to show the
king, that he may save his credit.&nbsp; He has promised Arundel
that he will return.&nbsp; And return he will.&nbsp; So onward he
goes to the &lsquo;Triangle Islands.&rsquo;&nbsp; There he sends
off five small vessels for the Orinoco, with four hundred
men.&nbsp; The faithful Keymis has to command and guide the
expedition.&nbsp; Sir Warham is lying ill of the fever, all but
dead; so George Raleigh is sent in his place as sergeant-major,
and with him five land companies, one of which is commanded by
young Walter, Raleigh&rsquo;s son; another by a Captain Parker,
of whom we shall have a word to say presently.</p>
<p>Keymis&rsquo;s orders are explicit.&nbsp; He is to go up; find
the mine, and open it; and if the Spaniards attack him, repel
force by force: but he is to avoid, if possible, an encounter
with them: not for fear of breaking the peace, but because he has
&lsquo;a scum of men, a few gentlemen excepted, and I would not
for all the world receive a blow from the Spaniards to the
dishonour of our nation.&rsquo;&nbsp; There we have no
concealment of hostile instructions, any more than in
Raleigh&rsquo;s admirable instructions to his fleet, which, after
laying down excellent laws for morality, religion, and
discipline, go on with clause after clause as to what is to be
done if they meet &lsquo;the enemy.&rsquo;&nbsp; What
enemy?&nbsp; Why, all Spanish ships which sail the seas; and who,
if they happen to be sufficiently numerous, will assuredly
attack, sink, burn, and destroy Raleigh&rsquo;s whole squadron,
for daring to sail for that continent which Spain claims as its
own.</p>
<p>Raleigh runs up the coast to Trinidad once more, in through
the Serpent&rsquo;s Mouth, and round Punto Gallo to the lake of
pitch, where all recruit themselves with fish and armadillos,
&lsquo;pheasant&rsquo; (Penelope), &lsquo;palmitos&rsquo;
(Moriche palm fruit?), and guavas, and await the return of the
expedition from the last day of December to the middle of
February.&nbsp; They see something of the Spaniards
meanwhile.&nbsp; Sir John Ferns is sent up to Port of Spain to
try if they will trade for tobacco.&nbsp; The Spaniards parley;
in the midst of the parley pour a volley of musketry into them at
forty paces, yet hurt never a man; and send them off calling them
thieves and traitors.&nbsp; Fray Simon&rsquo;s Spanish account of
the matter is that Raleigh intended to disembark his men, that
they might march inland on San Joseph.&nbsp; He may be excused
for the guess; seeing that Raleigh had done the very same thing
some seventeen years before.&nbsp; If Raleigh was treacherous
then, his treason punished itself now.&nbsp; However, I must
believe that Raleigh is not likely to have told a lie for his own
private amusement in his own private diary.</p>
<p>On the 29th the Spaniards attack three men and a boy who are
ashore boiling the fossil pitch; kill one man, and carry off the
boy.&nbsp; Raleigh, instead of going up to Port of Spain and
demanding satisfaction, as he would have been justified in doing
after this second attack, remains quietly where he is, expecting
daily to be attacked by Spanish armadas, and resolved to
&lsquo;burn by their sides.&rsquo;&nbsp; Happily, or unhappily,
he escapes them.&nbsp; Probably he thinks they waited for him at
Margarita, expecting him to range the Spanish main.</p>
<p>At last the weary days of sickness and anxiety succeeded to
days of terror.&nbsp; On the 1st of February a strange report
comes by an Indian.&nbsp; An inland savage has brought confused
and contradictory news down the river that San Thom&eacute; is
sacked, the governor and two Spanish captains slain (names given)
and two English captains, nameless.&nbsp; After this entry follow
a few confused ones, set down as happening in January, concerning
attempts to extract the truth from the Indians, and the
negligence of the mariners, who are diligent in nothing but
pillaging and stealing.&nbsp; And so ends abruptly this sad
document.</p>
<p>The truth comes at last&mdash;but when, does not
appear&mdash;in a letter from Keymis, dated January 8.&nbsp; San
Thom&eacute; has been stormed, sacked, and burnt.&nbsp; Four
refiners&rsquo; houses were found in it; the best in the town; so
that the Spaniards have been mining there; but no coin or bullion
except a little plate.&nbsp; One English captain is killed, and
that captain is Walter Raleigh, his firstborn.&nbsp; He died
leading them on, when some, &lsquo;more careful of valour and
safety, began to recoil shamefully.&rsquo;&nbsp; His last words
were, &lsquo;Lord have mercy upon me and prosper our
enterprise.&rsquo;&nbsp; A Spanish captain, Erinetta, struck him
down with the butt of a musket after he had received a
bullet.&nbsp; John Plessington, his sergeant, avenged him by
running Erinetta through with his halbert.</p>
<p>Keymis has not yet been to the mine; he could not, &lsquo;by
reason of the murmurings, discords, and vexations&rsquo;; but he
will go at once, make trial of the mine, and come down to
Trinidad by the Macareo mouth.&nbsp; He sends a parcel of
scattered papers, a roll of tobacco, a tortoise, some oranges and
lemons.&nbsp; &lsquo;Praying God to give you health and strength
of body, and a mind armed against all extremities, I rest ever to
be commanded, your lordship&rsquo;s, Keymish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh Absalom, my son, my son, would God I had died for
thee!&rsquo;&nbsp; But weeping is in vain.&nbsp; The noble lad
sleeps there under the palm-trees, beside the mighty tropic
stream, while the fair Basset, &lsquo;his bride in the sight of
God,&rsquo; recks not of him as she wanders in the woods of
Umberleigh, wife to the son of Raleigh&rsquo;s deadliest
foe.&nbsp; Raleigh, Raleigh, surely God&rsquo;s blessing is not
on this voyage of thine.&nbsp; Surely He hath set thy misdeeds
before Him, and thy secret sins in the light of His
countenance.</p>
<p>Another blank of misery: but his honour is still safe.&nbsp;
Keymis will return with that gold ore, that pledge of his good
faith for which he has ventured all.&nbsp; Surely God will let
that come after all, now that he has paid as its price his
first-born&rsquo;s blood?</p>
<p>At last Keymis returns with thinned numbers.&nbsp; All are
weary, spirit-broken, discontented, mutinous.&nbsp; Where is the
gold ore?</p>
<p>There is none.&nbsp; Keymis has never been to the mine after
all.&nbsp; His companions curse him as a traitor who has helped
Raleigh to deceive them into ruin; the mine is imaginary&mdash;a
lie.&nbsp; The crews are ready to break into open mutiny; after a
while they will do so.</p>
<p>Yes, God is setting this man&rsquo;s secret sins in the light
of His countenance.&nbsp; If he has been ambitious, his ambition
has punished itself now.&nbsp; If he has cared more for his own
honour than for his wife and children, that sin too has punished
itself.&nbsp; If he has (which I affirm not) tampered with truth
for the sake of what seemed to him noble and just ends, that too
has punished itself; for his men do not trust him.&nbsp; If he
has (which I affirm not) done any wrong in that matter of Cobham,
that too has punished itself: for his men, counting him as <i>non
ens</i> in law, will not respect or obey him.&nbsp; If he has
spoken, after his old fashion, rash and exaggerated words, and
goes on speaking them, even though it be through the pressure of
despair, that too shall punish itself; and for every idle word
that he shall say, God will bring him into judgment.&nbsp; And
why, but because he is noble?&nbsp; Why, but because he is nearer
to God by a whole heaven than others whom God lets fatten on
their own sins, having no understanding, because they are in
honour, and having children at their hearts&rsquo; desire, and
leaving the rest of their substance to their babes?&nbsp; Not so
does God deal with His elect when they will try to worship at
once self and Him; He requires truth in the inward parts, and
will purge them till they are true, and single-eyed, and full of
light.</p>
<p>Keymis returns with the wreck of his party.&nbsp; The scene
between him and Raleigh may be guessed.&nbsp; Keymis has excuse
on excuse.&nbsp; He could not get obeyed after young
Raleigh&rsquo;s death: he expected to find that Sir Walter was
either dead of his sickness or of grief for his son, and had no
wish &lsquo;to enrich a company of rascals who made no account of
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; He dare not go up to the mine because (and here
Raleigh thinks his excuse fair) the fugitive Spaniards lay in the
craggy woods through which he would have to pass, and that he had
not men enough even to hold the town securely.&nbsp; If he
reached the mine and left a company there, he had no provisions
for them; and he dared not send backward and forward to the town
while the Spaniards were in the woods.&nbsp; The warnings sent by
Gondomar had undone all, and James&rsquo;s treachery had done its
work.&nbsp; So Keymis, &lsquo;thinking it a greater error, so he
said, to discover the mine to the Spaniards than to excuse
himself to the Company, said that he could not find
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; From all which one thing at least is evident,
that Keymis believed in the existence of the mine.</p>
<p>Raleigh &lsquo;rejects these fancies&rsquo;; tells him before
divers gentlemen that &lsquo;a blind man might find it by the
marks which Keymis himself had set down under his hand&rsquo;:
that &lsquo;his case of losing so many men in the woods&rsquo;
was a mere pretence: after Walter was slain, he knew that Keymis
had no care of any man&rsquo;s surviving.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have
undone me, wounded my credit with the King past recovery.&nbsp;
As you have followed your own advice, and not mine, you must
satisfy his Majesty.&nbsp; It shall be glad if you can do it: but
I cannot.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is no use dwelling on such vain
regrets and reproaches.&nbsp; Raleigh perhaps is bitter,
unjust.&nbsp; As he himself writes twice, to his wife and Sir
Ralph Winwood, his &lsquo;brains are broken.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
writes to them both, and re-opens the letters to add long
postscripts, at his wits&rsquo; end.&nbsp; Keymis goes off;
spends a few miserable days; and then enters Raleigh&rsquo;s
cabin.&nbsp; He has written his apology to Lord Arundel, and begs
Raleigh to allow of it.&nbsp; &lsquo;No.&nbsp; You have undone me
by your obstinacy.&nbsp; I will not favour or colour your former
folly.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Is that your resolution,
sir?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It is.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I know not
then, sir, what course to take.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so he goes out,
and into his own cabin overhead.&nbsp; A minute after a
pistol-shot is heard.&nbsp; Raleigh sends up a boy to know the
reason.&nbsp; Keymis answers from within that he has fired it off
because it had been long charged; and all is quiet.</p>
<p>Half an hour after the boy goes into the cabin.&nbsp; Keymis
is lying on his bed, the pistol by him.&nbsp; The boy moves
him.&nbsp; The pistol-shot has broken a rib, and gone no further;
but as the corpse is turned over, a long knife is buried in that
desperate heart.&nbsp; Another of the old heroes is gone to his
wild account.</p>
<p>Gradually drops of explanation ooze out.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;Sergeant-major, Raleigh&rsquo;s nephew, and others,
confess that Keymis told them that he could have brought them in
two hours to the mine: but as the young heir was slain, and his
father was unpardoned and not like to live, he had no reason to
open the mine, either for the Spaniard or the King.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Those latter words are significant.&nbsp; What cared the old
Elizabethan seaman for the weal of such a king?&nbsp; And,
indeed, what good to such a king would all the mines in Guiana
be?&nbsp; They answered that the King, nevertheless, had
&lsquo;granted Raleigh his heart&rsquo;s desire under the great
seal.&rsquo;&nbsp; He replied that &lsquo;the grant to Raleigh
was to a man <i>non ens</i> in law, and therefore of no
force.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here, too, James&rsquo;s policy has worked
well.&nbsp; How could men dare or persevere under such a
cloud?</p>
<p>How, indeed, could they have found heart to sail at all?&nbsp;
The only answer is that they knew Raleigh well enough to have
utter faith in him, and that Keymis himself knew of the mine.</p>
<p>Puppies at home in England gave out that he had killed himself
from remorse at having deceived so many gentlemen with an
imaginary phantom.&nbsp; Every one, of course, according to his
measure of charity, has power and liberty to assume any motive
which he will.&nbsp; Mine is simply the one which shows upon the
face of the documents; that the old follower, devoted alike to
the dead son and to the doomed father, feeling that he had, he
scarce knew how, failed in the hour of need, frittered away the
last chance of a mighty enterprise which had been his fixed idea
for years, and ruined the man whom he adored, avenged upon
himself the fault of having disobeyed orders, given peremptorily,
and to be peremptorily executed.</p>
<p>Here, perhaps, my tale should end; for all beyond is but the
waking of the corpse.&nbsp; The last death-struggle of the
Elizabethan heroism is over, and all its remains vanish slowly in
an undignified, sickening way.&nbsp; All epics end so.&nbsp;
After the war of Troy, Achilles must die by coward Paris&rsquo;s
arrow, in some mysterious, confused, pitiful fashion; and stately
Hecuba must rail herself into a very dog, and bark for ever
shamefully around lonely Cynossema.&nbsp; Young David ends as a
dotard&mdash;Solomon as worse.&nbsp; Glorious Alexander must die,
half of fever, half of drunkenness, as the fool dieth.&nbsp;
Charles the Fifth, having thrown all away but his follies, ends
in a convent, a superstitious imbecile; Napoleon squabbles to the
last with Sir Hudson Lowe about champagne.&nbsp; It must be so;
and the glory must be God&rsquo;s alone.&nbsp; For in great men,
and great times, there is nothing good or vital but what is of
God, and not of man&rsquo;s self; and when He taketh away that
divine breath they die, and return again to their dust.&nbsp; But
the earth does not lose; for when He sendeth forth His Spirit
they live, and renew the face of the earth.&nbsp; A new
generation arises, with clearer sight, with fuller experience,
sometimes with nobler aims; and</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The old order changeth, giveth place to the
new,<br />
And God fulfils himself in many ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Elizabethan epic did not end a day too soon.&nbsp; There
was no more life left in it; and God had something better in
store for England.&nbsp; Raleigh&rsquo;s ideal was a noble one:
but God&rsquo;s was nobler far.&nbsp; Raleigh would have made her
a gold kingdom, like Spain, and destroyed her very vitals by that
gold, as Spain was destroyed.&nbsp; And all the while the great
and good God was looking steadfastly upon that little struggling
Virginian village, Raleigh&rsquo;s first-born, forgotten in his
new mighty dreams, and saying, &lsquo;Here will I dwell, for I
have a delight therein.&rsquo;&nbsp; There, and not in Guiana;
upon the simple tillers of the soil, not among wild reckless
gold-hunters, would His blessing rest.&nbsp; The very coming
darkness would bring brighter light.&nbsp; The evil age itself
would be the parent of new good, and drive across the seas
steadfast Pilgrim Fathers and generous Royalist Cavaliers, to be
the parents of a mightier nation than has ever yet possessed the
earth.&nbsp; Verily, God&rsquo;s ways are wonderful, and His
counsels in the great deep.</p>
<p>So ends the Elizabethan epic.&nbsp; Must we follow the corpse
to the grave?&nbsp; It is necessary.</p>
<p>And now, &lsquo;you gentlemen of England, who sit at home at
ease,&rsquo; what would you have done in like case?&mdash;Your
last die thrown; your last stake lost; your honour, as you fancy,
stained for ever; your eldest son dead in battle&mdash;What would
you have done?&nbsp; What Walter Raleigh did was this.&nbsp; He
kept his promise.&nbsp; He had promised Lord Arundel to return to
England; and return he did.</p>
<p>But it is said his real intention, as he himself confessed,
was to turn pirate and take the Mexico fleet.</p>
<p>That wild thoughts of such a deed may have crossed his mind,
may have been a terrible temptation to him, may even have broken
out in hasty words, one does not deny.&nbsp; He himself says that
he spoke of such a thing &lsquo;to keep his men
together.&rsquo;&nbsp; All depends on how the words were
spoken.&nbsp; The form of the sentence, the tone of voice, is
everything.&nbsp; Who could blame him, if seeing some of the
captains whom he had most trusted deserting him, his men heaping
him with every slander, and, as he solemnly swore on the
scaffold, calling witnesses thereto by name, forcing him to take
an oath that he would not return to England before they would
have him, and locking him into his own cabin&mdash;who could
blame him, I ask, for saying in that daring off-hand way of his,
which has so often before got him into trouble, &lsquo;Come, my
lads, do not despair.&nbsp; If the worst comes to the worst,
there is the Plate-fleet to fall back upon&rsquo;?&nbsp; When I
remember, too, that the taking of the said Plate-fleet was in
Raleigh&rsquo;s eyes an altogether just thing; and that he knew
perfectly that if he succeeded therein he would be backed by the
public opinion of all England, and probably buy his pardon of
James, who, if he loved Spain well, loved money better; my
surprise rather is, that he did not go and do it.&nbsp; As for
any meeting of captains in his cabin and serious proposal of such
a plan, I believe it to be simply one of the innumerable lies
which James inserted in his &lsquo;Declaration,&rsquo; gathered
from the tales of men who, fearing (and reasonably) lest their
heads should follow Raleigh&rsquo;s, tried to curry favour by
slandering him.&nbsp; This &lsquo;Declaration&rsquo; has been so
often exposed that I may safely pass it by; and pass by almost as
safely the argument which some have drawn from a chance
expression of his in his pathetic letter to Lady Raleigh, in
which he &lsquo;hopes that God would send him somewhat before his
return.&rsquo;&nbsp; To prove an intention of piracy in the
despairing words of a ruined man writing to comfort a ruined wife
for the loss of her first-born is surely to deal out hard
measure.&nbsp; Heaven have mercy upon us, if all the hasty words
which woe has wrung from our hearts are to be so judged either by
man or God!</p>
<p>Sir Julius C&aelig;sar, again, one of the commission appointed
to examine him, informs us that, on being confronted with
Captains St. Leger and Pennington, he confessed that he proposed
the taking of the Mexico fleet if the mine failed.&nbsp; To which
I can only answer, that all depends on how the thing was said,
and that this is the last fact which we should find in Sir
Julius&rsquo;s notes, which are, it is confessed, so confused,
obscure, and full of gaps, as to be often hardly
intelligible.&nbsp; The same remark applies to Wilson&rsquo;s
story, which I agree with Mr. Tytler in thinking worthless.&nbsp;
Wilson, it must be understood, is employed after Raleigh&rsquo;s
return as a spy upon him, which office he executes, all confess
(and Wilson himself as much as any), as falsely, treacherously,
and hypocritically as did ever sinful man; and, <i>inter
alia</i>, he has this, &lsquo;This day he told me what discourse
he and the Lord Chancellor had about taking the Plate-fleet,
which he confessed he would have taken had he lighted on
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; To which my Lord Chancellor said, &lsquo;Why,
you would have been a pirate.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo;
quoth he, &lsquo;did you ever know of any that were pirates for
millions?&nbsp; They only that wish for small things are
pirates.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, setting aside the improbability that
Raleigh should go out of his way to impeach himself to the man
whom he must have known was set there to find matter for his
death, all, we say, depends on how it was said.&nbsp; If the Lord
Chancellor ever said to Raleigh, &lsquo;To take the Mexico fleet
would be piracy,&rsquo; it would have been just like Raleigh to
give such an answer.&nbsp; The speech is a perfectly true one:
Raleigh knew the world, no man better; and saw through its
hollowness, and the cant and hypocrisy of his generation; and he
sardonically states an undeniable fact.&nbsp; He is not
expressing his own morality, but that of the world; just as he is
doing in that passage of his &lsquo;Apology,&rsquo; about which I
must complain of Mr. Napier.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was a maxim of
his,&rsquo; says Mr. Napier, &lsquo;that good success admits of
no examination.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is not fair.&nbsp; The sentence
in the original goes on, &lsquo;so the contrary allows of no
excuse, however reasonable and just whatsoever.&rsquo;&nbsp; His
argument all through the beginning of the &lsquo;Apology,&rsquo;
supported by instance on instance from history, is&mdash;I cannot
get a just hearing, because I have failed in opening this
mine.&nbsp; So it is always.&nbsp; Glory covers the multitude of
sins.&nbsp; But a man who has failed is a fair mark for every
slanderer, puppy, ignoramus, discontented mutineer; as I am
now.&nbsp; What else, in the name of common sense, could have
been his argument?&nbsp; Does Mr. Napier really think that
Raleigh, even if, in the face of all the noble and pious words
which he had written, he held so immoral a doctrine, would have
been shameless and senseless enough to assert his own rascality
in an apology addressed to the most &lsquo;religious&rsquo; of
kings in the most canting of generations?</p>
<p>But still more astonished am I at the use which has been made
of Captain Parker&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; The letter is written by
a man in a state of frantic rage and disappointment.&nbsp; There
never was any mine, he believes now.&nbsp; Keymis&rsquo;s
&lsquo;delays we found mere delusions; for he was false to all
men and hateful to himself, loathing to live since he could do no
more villany.&nbsp; I will speak no more of this hateful fellow
to God and man.&rsquo;&nbsp; And it is on the testimony of a man
in this temper that we are asked to believe that &lsquo;the
admiral and vice-admiral,&rsquo; Raleigh and St. Leger, are going
to the Western Islands &lsquo;to look for homeward-bound
men&rsquo;: if, indeed, the looking for homeward-bound men means
really looking for the Spanish fleet, and not merely for recruits
for their crews.&nbsp; I never recollect&mdash;and I have read
pretty fully the sea-records of those days&mdash;such a synonym
used either for the Mexican or Indian fleet.&nbsp; But let this
be as it may, the letter proves too much.&nbsp; For, first, it
proves that whosoever is not going to turn &lsquo;pirate,&rsquo;
our calm and charitable friend Captain Parker is; &lsquo;for my
part, by the permission of God, I will either <i>make a
voyage</i> or bury myself in the sea.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, what
making a voyage meant there is no doubt; and the sum total of the
letter is, that a man intending to turn rover himself accuses,
under the influence of violent passion, his comrades of doing the
like.&nbsp; We may believe him about himself: about others, we
shall wait for testimony a little less interested.</p>
<p>But the letter proves too much again.&nbsp; For Parker says
that &lsquo;Witney and Woolaston are gone off a-head to look for
homeward-bound men,&rsquo; thus agreeing with Raleigh&rsquo;s
message to his wife, that &lsquo;Witney, for whom I sold all my
plate at Plymouth, and to whom I gave more credit and countenance
than to all the captains of my fleet, ran from me at the
Grenadas, and Woolaston with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And now, reader, how does this of Witney, and Woolaston, and
Parker&rsquo;s intentions to &lsquo;pirate&rsquo; separately, if
it be true, agree with King James&rsquo;s story of
Raleigh&rsquo;s calling a council of war and proposing an attack
on the Plate-fleet?&nbsp; One or the other must needs be a lie;
probably both.&nbsp; Witney&rsquo;s ship was of only 160 tons;
Woolaston&rsquo;s probably smaller.&nbsp; Five such ships would
be required, as any reader of Hakluyt must know, to take a single
Carack; and it would be no use running the risk of hanging for
any less prize.&nbsp; The Spanish main was warned and armed, and
the Western Isles also.&nbsp; Is it possible that these two men
would have been insane enough in such circumstances to go without
Raleigh, if they could have gone with him?&nbsp; And is it
possible that he, if he had any set purpose of attacking the
Plate-fleet, would not have kept them, in order to attempt that
with him which neither they nor he could do without each
other.&nbsp; Moreover, no &lsquo;piratical&rsquo; act ever took
place; if any had, we should have heard enough about it; and why
is Parker to be believed against Raleigh alone, when there is
little doubt that he slandered all the rest of the
captains?&nbsp; Lastly, it was to this very Parker, with Mr.
Tresham and another gentleman, that Raleigh appealed by name on
the scaffold, as witnesses that it was his crew who tried to keep
him from going home, and not he them.</p>
<p>My own belief is, and it is surely simple and rational enough,
that Raleigh&rsquo;s &lsquo;brains,&rsquo; as he said,
&lsquo;were broken&rsquo;; that he had no distinct plan: but
that, loth to leave the New World without a second attempt on
Guiana, he went up to Newfoundland to re-victual, &lsquo;and with
good hope,&rsquo; as he wrote to Winwood himself, &lsquo;of
keeping the sea till August with some four reasonable good
ships,&rsquo; probably, as Oldys remarks, to try a trading
voyage; but found his gentlemen too dispirited and incredulous,
his men too mutinous to do anything; and seeing his ships go home
one by one, at last followed them himself, because he had
promised Arundel and Pembroke so to do; having, after all, as he
declared on the scaffold, extreme difficulty in persuading his
men to land at all in England.&nbsp; The other lies about him, as
of his having intended to desert his soldiers in Guiana, his
having taken no tools to work the mine, and so forth, one only
notices to say that the &lsquo;Declaration&rsquo; takes care to
make the most of them, without deigning, after its fashion, to
adduce any proof but anonymous hearsays.&nbsp; If it be true that
Bacon drew up that famous document, it reflects no credit either
on his honesty or his &lsquo;inductive science.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So Raleigh returns, anchors in Plymouth.&nbsp; He finds that
Captain North has brought home the news of his mishaps, and that
there is a proclamation against him, which, by the bye, lies, for
it talks of limitations and cautions given to Raleigh which do
not appear in his commission; and, moreover, that a warrant is
out for his apprehension.&nbsp; He sends his men on shore, and
starts for London to surrender himself, in company with faithful
Captain King, who alone clings to him to the last, and from whom
we have details of the next few days.&nbsp; Near Ashburton he is
met by Sir Lewis Stukely, his near kinsman, Vice-Admiral of
Devon, who has orders to arrest him.&nbsp; Raleigh tells him that
he has saved him the trouble; and the two return to Plymouth,
where Stukely, strangely enough, leaves him at liberty and rides
about the country.&nbsp; We should be slow in imputing baseness:
but one cannot help suspecting from Stukely&rsquo;s subsequent
conduct that he had from the first private orders to give Raleigh
a chance of trying to escape, in order to have a handle against
him, such as his own deeds had not yet given.</p>
<p>The ruse, if it existed then, as it did afterwards,
succeeds.&nbsp; Raleigh hears bad news.&nbsp; Gondomar
has&mdash;or has not&mdash;told his story to the king by crying,
&lsquo;<i>Piratas</i>! <i>piratas</i>! <i>piratas</i>!&rsquo; and
then rushing out without explanation.&nbsp; James is in terror
lest what had happened should break off the darling Spanish
match.</p>
<p>Raleigh foresees ruin, perhaps death.&nbsp; Life is sweet, and
Guiana is yet where it was.&nbsp; He may win a basketful of the
ore still, and prove himself no liar.&nbsp; He will escape to
France.&nbsp; Faithful King finds him a Rochelle ship; he takes
boat to her, goes half way, and returns.&nbsp; Honour is sweeter
than life, and James may yet be just.&nbsp; The next day he
bribes the master to wait for him one more day, starts for the
ship once more, and again returns to Plymouth&mdash;so King will
make oath&mdash;of his own free will.&nbsp; The temptation must
have been terrible and the sin none.&nbsp; What kept him from
yielding but innocence and honour?&nbsp; He will clear himself;
and if not, abide the worst.&nbsp; Stukely and James found out
these facts, and made good use of them afterwards.&nbsp; For now
comes &lsquo;a severe letter from my Lords&rsquo; to bring
Raleigh up as speedily as his health will permit; and with it
comes one Mannourie, a French quack, of whom honest King takes
little note at the time, but who will make himself
remembered.</p>
<p>And now begins a series of scenes most pitiable;
Raleigh&rsquo;s brains are indeed broken.&nbsp; He is old,
worn-out with the effects of his fever, lamed, ruined,
broken-hearted, and, for the first time in his life, weak and
silly.&nbsp; He takes into his head the paltriest notion that he
can gain time to pacify the King by feigning himself sick.&nbsp;
He puts implicit faith in the rogue Mannourie, whom he has never
seen before.&nbsp; He sends forward Lady Raleigh to
London&mdash;perhaps ashamed&mdash;as who would not have
been?&mdash;to play the fool in that sweet presence; and with her
good Captain King, who is to engage one Cotterell, an old servant
of Raleigh&rsquo;s, to find a ship wherein to escape, if the
worst comes to the worst.&nbsp; Cotterell sends King to an old
boatswain of his, who owns a ketch.&nbsp; She is to lie off
Tilbury; and so King waits Raleigh&rsquo;s arrival.&nbsp; What
passed in the next four or five days will never be truly known,
for our only account comes from two self-convicted villains,
Stukely and Mannourie.&nbsp; On these details I shall not
enter.&nbsp; First, because one cannot trust a word of them;
secondly, because no one will wish to hear them who feels, as I
do, how pitiable and painful is the sight of a great heart and
mind utterly broken.&nbsp; Neither shall I spend time on
Stukely&rsquo;s villanous treatment of Raleigh, for which he had
a commission from James in writing; his pretending to help him to
escape, his going down the Thames in a boat with him, his trying
in vain to make honest King as great a rogue as himself.&nbsp;
Like most rascalities, Stukely&rsquo;s conduct, even as he
himself states it, is very obscure.&nbsp; All that we can see is,
that Cotterell told Stukely everything: that Stukely bade
Cotterell carry on the deceit; that Stukely had orders from
headquarters to incite Raleigh to say or do something which might
form a fresh ground of accusal; that, being a clumsy rogue, he
failed, and fell back on abetting Raleigh&rsquo;s escape, as a
last resource.&nbsp; Be it as it may, he throws off the mask as
soon as Raleigh has done enough to prove an intent to escape;
arrests him, and conducts him to the Tower.</p>
<p>There two shameful months are spent in trying to find out some
excuse for Raleigh&rsquo;s murder.&nbsp; Wilson is set over him
as a spy; his letters to his wife are intercepted.&nbsp; Every
art is used to extort a confession of a great plot with France,
and every art fails utterly&mdash;simply, it seems to me, because
there was no plot.&nbsp; Raleigh writes an apology, letters of
entreaty, self-justification, what not; all, in my opinion, just
and true enough; but like his speech on the scaffold, weak,
confused&mdash;the product of a &lsquo;broken brain.&rsquo;&nbsp;
However, his head must come off; and as a last resource, it must
be taken off upon the sentence of fifteen years ago, and he who
was condemned for plotting with Spain must die for plotting
against her.&nbsp; It is a pitiable business: but as Osborne
says, in a passage (p.108 of his Memoirs of James) for which one
freely forgives him all his sins and lies, and they are
many&mdash;&lsquo;As the foolish idolaters were wont to sacrifice
the choicest of their children to the devil, so our king gave up
his incomparable jewel to the will of this monster of ambition
(the Spaniard), under the pretence of a superannuated
transgression, contrary to the opinion of the more honest sort of
gownsmen, who maintained that his Majesty&rsquo;s pardon lay
inclusively in the commission he gave him on his setting out to
sea; it being incongruous that he, who remained under the notion
of one dead in the law, should as a general dispose of the lives
of others, not being himself master of his own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But no matter.&nbsp; He must die.&nbsp; The Queen intercedes
for him, as do all honest men: but in vain.&nbsp; He has
twenty-four hours&rsquo; notice to prepare for death; eats a good
breakfast; takes a cup of sack and a pipe; makes a rambling
speech, in which one notes only the intense belief that he is an
honest man, and the intense desire to make others believe so, in
the very smallest matters; and then dies smilingly, as one weary
of life.&nbsp; One makes no comment.&nbsp; Raleigh&rsquo;s life
really ended on that day that poor Keymis returned from San
Thom&eacute;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And then?</p>
<p>As we said, Truth is stranger than fiction.&nbsp; No dramatist
dare invent a &lsquo;poetic justice&rsquo; more perfect than fell
upon the traitor.&nbsp; It is not always so, no doubt.&nbsp; God
reserves many a greater sinner for that most awful of all
punishments&mdash;impunity.&nbsp; But there are crises in a
nation&rsquo;s life in which God makes terrible examples, to put
before the most stupid and sensual the choice of Hercules, the
upward road of life, the downward one which leads to the
pit.&nbsp; Since the time of Pharaoh and the Red Sea host,
history is full of such palpable, unmistakable revelations of the
Divine Nemesis; and in England, too, at that moment, the crisis
was there; and the judgment of God was revealed
accordingly.&nbsp; Sir Lewis Stukely remained, it seems, at
court; high in favour with James: but he found, nevertheless,
that people looked darkly on him.&nbsp; Like many self-convicted
rogues, he must needs thrust his head into his own shame; and one
day he goes to good old Lord Charles Howard&rsquo;s house; for
being Vice-Admiral of Devon, he has affairs with the old Armada
hero.</p>
<p>The old lion explodes in an unexpected roar.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Darest thou come into my presence, thou base fellow, who
art reputed the common scorn and contempt of all men?&nbsp; Were
it not in mine own house I would cudgel thee with my staff for
presuming to speak to me!&rsquo;&nbsp; Stukely, his tail between
his legs, goes off and complains to James.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
should I do with him?&nbsp; Hang him?&nbsp; On my sawle, mon, if
I hung all that spoke ill of thee, all the trees in the island
were too few.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such is the gratitude of kings, thinks
Stukely; and retires to write foolish pamphlets in
self-justification, which, unfortunately for his memory, still
remain to make bad worse.</p>
<p>Within twelve months he, the rich and proud Vice-Admiral of
Devon, with a shield of sixteen quarterings and the blood-royal
in his veins, was detected debasing the King&rsquo;s coin within
the precincts of the royal palace, together with his old
accomplice Mannourie, who, being taken, confessed that his
charges against Raleigh were false.&nbsp; He fled, a ruined man,
back to his native county and his noble old seat of Affton; but
At&eacute; is on the heels of such&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Slowly she tracks him and sure, as a
lyme-hound, sudden she grips him,<br />
Crushing him, blind in his pride, for a sign and a terror to
mortals.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A terrible plebiscitum had been passed in the West country
against the betrayer of its last Worthy.&nbsp; The gentlemen
closed their doors against him; the poor refused him&mdash;so
goes the legend&mdash;fire and water.&nbsp; Driven by the Furies,
he fled from Affton, and wandered westward down the vale of Taw,
away to Appledore, and there took boat, and out into the
boundless Atlantic, over the bar, now crowded with shipping, for
which Raleigh&rsquo;s genius had discovered a new trade and a new
world.</p>
<p>Sixteen miles to the westward, like a blue cloud on the
horizon, rises the ultima Thule of Devon, the little isle of
Lundy.&nbsp; There one outlying peak of granite, carrying up a
shelf of slate upon its southern flank, has defied the waves, and
formed an island some three miles long, desolate, flat-headed,
fretted by every frost and storm, walled all round with four
hundred feet of granite cliff, sacred only, then at least, to
puffins and pirates.&nbsp; Over the single landing-place frowns
from the cliff the keep of an old ruin, &lsquo;Moresco
Castle,&rsquo; as they call it still, where some bold rover, Sir
John de Moresco, in the times of the old Edwards, worked his
works of darkness: a gray, weird, uncanny pile of moorstone,
through which all the winds of heaven howl day and night.</p>
<p>In a chamber of that ruin died Sir Lewis Stukely, Lord of
Affton, cursing God and man.</p>
<p>These things are true.&nbsp; Said I not well that reality is
stranger than romance?</p>
<p>But no Nemesis followed James.</p>
<p>The answer will depend much upon what readers consider to be a
Nemesis.&nbsp; If to have found England one of the greatest
countries in Europe, and to have left it one of the most
inconsiderable and despicable; if to be fooled by flatterers to
the top of his bent, until he fancied himself all but a god,
while he was not even a man, and could neither speak the truth,
keep himself sober, nor look on a drawn sword without shrinking;
if, lastly, to have left behind him a son who, in spite of many
chivalrous instincts unknown to his father, had been so
indoctrinated in that father&rsquo;s vices as to find it
impossible to speak the truth even when it served his purpose; if
all these things be no Nemesis, then none fell on James
Stuart.</p>
<p>But of that son, at least, the innocent blood was
required.&nbsp; He, too, had his share in the sin.&nbsp; In Carew
Raleigh&rsquo;s simple and manful petition to the Commons of
England for the restoration of his inheritance we find a
significant fact stated without one word of comment, bitter or
otherwise.&nbsp; At Prince Henry&rsquo;s death the Sherborne
lands had been given again to Carr, Lord Somerset.&nbsp; To him,
too, &lsquo;the whirligig of time brought round its
revenges,&rsquo; and he lost them when arraigned and condemned
for poisoning Sir Thomas Overbury.&nbsp; Then Sir John Digby,
afterwards Earl of Bristol, begged Sherborne of the King, and had
it.&nbsp; Pembroke (Shakspeare&rsquo;s Pembroke) brought young
Carew to court, hoping to move the tyrant&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp;
James saw him and shuddered; perhaps conscience stricken, perhaps
of mere cowardice.&nbsp; &lsquo;He looked like the ghost of his
father,&rsquo; as he well might, to that guilty soul.&nbsp; Good
Pembroke advised his young kinsman to travel, which he did till
James&rsquo;s death in the next year.&nbsp; Then coming
over&mdash;this is his own story&mdash;he asked of Parliament to
be restored in blood, that he might inherit aught that might fall
to him in England.&nbsp; His petition was read twice in the
Lords.&nbsp; Whereon &lsquo;King Charles sent Sir James
Fullarton, then of the bed-chamber, to Mr. Raleigh to command him
to come to him; and being brought in, the King, after using him
with great civility, notwithstanding told him plainly that when
he was prince he had promised the Earl of Bristol to secure his
title to Sherborne against the heirs of Sir Walter Raleigh;
whereon the earl had given him, then prince, ten thousand pounds;
that now he was bound to make good his promise, being king; that,
therefore, unless he would quit his right and title to Sherborne,
he neither could nor would pass his bill of
restoration.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Young Raleigh, like a good Englishman, &lsquo;urged,&rsquo; he
says, &lsquo;the justness of his cause; that he desired only the
liberty of the subject, and to be left to the law, which was
never denied any freeman.&rsquo;&nbsp; The King remained
obstinate.&nbsp; His noble brother&rsquo;s love for the mighty
dead weighed nothing with him, much less justice.&nbsp; Poor
young Raleigh was forced to submit.&nbsp; The act for his
restoration was passed, reserving Sherborne for Lord Bristol, and
Charles patched up the affair by allowing to Lady Raleigh and her
son after her a life pension of four hundred a year.</p>
<p>Young Carew tells his story simply, and without a note of
bitterness; though he professes his intent to range himself and
his two sons for the future &lsquo;under the banner of the
Commons of England,&rsquo; he may be a royalist for any word
beside.&nbsp; Even where he mentions the awful curse of his
mother, he only alludes to its fulfilment by&mdash;&lsquo;that
which hath happened since to that royal family is too sad and
disastrous for me to repeat, and yet too visible not to be
discerned.&rsquo;&nbsp; We can have no doubt that he tells the
exact truth.&nbsp; Indeed the whole story fits Charles&rsquo;s
character to the smallest details.&nbsp; The want of any real
sense of justice, combined with the false notion of honour; the
implacable obstinacy; the contempt for that law by which alone he
held his crown; the combination of unkingliness in commanding a
private interview and shamelessness in confessing his own
meanness&mdash;all these are true notes of the man whose
deliberate suicide stands written, a warning to all bad rulers
till the end of time.&nbsp; But he must have been a rogue early
in life, and a needy rogue too.&nbsp; That ten thousand pounds of
Lord Bristol&rsquo;s money should make many a sentimentalist
reconsider&mdash;if, indeed, sentimentalists can be made to
reconsider, or even to consider, anything&mdash;their notion of
him as the incarnation of pious chivalry.</p>
<p>At least the ten thousand pounds cost Charles dear.</p>
<p>The widow&rsquo;s curse followed him home.&nbsp; Naseby fight
and the Whitehall scaffold were surely God&rsquo;s judgment of
such deeds, whatever man&rsquo;s may be.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
